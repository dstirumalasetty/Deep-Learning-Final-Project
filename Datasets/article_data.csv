It’s ""Sell In May"" indeed, said Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick in a tweet. With the S&P 500 Index down for the first days of May, the market has witnessed the longest losing streak to start a month since December 2022, which saw a five-session losing streak at the start of the month, he said.
The longest-ever has been nine in a row in December 1980, he added.
Detrick noted that the last time, the S&P 500 Index was down all five days of the week, ie Monday through Friday, was in late February 2020. The last time this happened in May was in 2012, he said.
“Long way to go, but $AAPL trying to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Detrick said.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported second-quarter results that exceeded expectations Thursday, in line with the positive earnings trend seen so far in the big tech space. The outperformance came as iPhone revenue exceeded expectations and the Services revenue climbed to a new record. 
Apple's Key Q2 Numbers: Cupertino, California-based Apple reported earnings per share of $1.52, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.43 per share.
The bottom line was flat with the year-ago period and down 19.2% from the previous quarter's $1.88 per share.
Revenue came in $94.8 billion versus the Street forecast of $92.96 million. This marks a 3% year-over-year decline and 19.1% sequential drop.
It should be noted the second quarter is one of Apple's seasonally slow periods, coming right after the holiday shopping season. 
Analysts, including Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring and Wedbush's Daniel Ives, were bracing for in-line March quarter results.
“We are pleased to report an all-time record in Services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,"" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO.

Prices as of 4 pm EST, 5/3/23
Macro
The Fed unanimously raised interest rates by 25 bps, bringing the benchmark rate above 5%.


For the first time since August 2019, the target rate is now higher than headline inflation.


The FOMC used more flexible language in its statement that left the door open for a pause at its next meeting.


However, Powell stressed that a rate cut in 2023—as markets expect—was not a part of the current outlook.



The latest ISM purchasing managers index revealed a services sector growing steadily.


April’s headline reading edged up to 51.9 from 51.2 in March driven by a surge in new orders and a rebound in exports.


Prices paid by businesses also edged up, however, suggesting inflationary pressures remain.



In contrast with Tuesday’s JOLTs data, yesterday’s ADP payroll numbers point to a resilient labor market.


US companies added 296,000 jobs in April, more than double the expected amount and the most since July.


Not exactly what the Fed wants to see.


Wage growth, on the other hand, suggests a cooling market as annual pay gains decelerated to 6.7%.

It's an occurrence not seen since March, when Silicon Valley Bank and other smaller banks failed. Investors' biggest concern remains the health of the financial sector, with bank stocks among the session's worst performers. 
The VIX fear index was up 15% today, while gold, another indicator of financial distrust, reached a new all-time high of $2,080 per ounce.
After the markets close, all eyes will be on Apple, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings report.

The S&P 500 index was down 0.9% as of midday trading in New York, while blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell 0.3%, dropping below 13,000 levels. 
Small-cap stocks were hit the hardest, with the Russell 2000 index losing 1.7%.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the last among the FAANGs to report its March quarter results. The results are important because they could confirm or question the strength of quarterly reports from other big techs.
Key Q2 Expectations: Cupertino, California-based Apple is expected to report earnings per share of $1.43 per share on revenue of $92.96 billion.

The consensus EPS estimate of $1.43 suggests a 5.92% drop from the year ago's $1.52 and a roughly 24% drop from the previous quarter's $1.88.
Street revenue estimate of $92.96 would mark a 4.4% drop from the year-ago quarter's $97.28 billion and a 20.7% decline from the first quarter's $117.2 billion.

It has to be noted here that the second quarter is one of Apple's seasonally slow quarters, coming right after the holiday-selling period.
In a recent note, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said that he expects in-line March quarter results.
Citing continued uncertainty, Apple refrained from giving revenue guidance for the second quarter. CFO Luca Maestri said on the first-quarter earnings calls that the company expects revenue performance similar to the December quarter and forex to continue to be a headwind.
Woodring said he expects Apple to announce a $90 billion incremental buyback authorization and a 5% year-over-year increase in dividends.

Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has been vociferous throughout the development, discussed the crisis again in a lengthy tweet.
What Happened: The regional banking system is at risk, said Ackman, who runs the hedge fund Pershing Square. Silicon Valley Bank's collapse served as a warning for uninsured depositors and the rapid rise in rates ""impaired assets and drained assets, he said.
""Zeroing out shareholders and bondholders massively increased banks' cost of capital,"" the fund manager said.
He also warned of looming commercial real estate losses. Incidentally, Warren Buffett's trusted lieutenant Charlie Munger recently sounded out a similar alarm.

Despite's Apple, Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) not-so-proactive approach, the analyst said Cupertino could be the ""one to benefit no matter where the industry goes.""
Apple Preps To Press The Pedal? Given Apple is a leading player in nearly everything regarding tech and consumer technology, the company will likely step up its AI efforts over the coming months, Ives said in a recent note.
The company's thrust on AI is evident from the 2020 acquisition of Xnor.ai, a spin-off from the non-profit Allen Institute for AI, he said. The tech giant would have the opportunity to leverage Xnor.ai capabilities into standard features within every iPhone, iPad and MacBook, including object and person recognition tools, he added.
The analyst also noted that Xnor.ai has recently developed a self-service platform for software developers to drop AI-centric code and data libraries into device-centric apps, allowing users to use AI models anywhere.

The Fed could stay on course despite the economic slowdown and raise rates at the upcoming May 2-3 meeting, according to Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist at LPL Financial.

He does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut by the end of the year if the economy becomes more unstable.

Insider sales should not be taken as the only indicator for making an investment or trading decision. At best, it can lend conviction to a selling decision.
Below is a look at a few recent notable insider sales. For more, check out  Benzinga's insider transactions  platform.

Wouldn’t it be nice to know how to use data to determine the perfect investment? In 1952, Harry Markowitz published an article titled “Portfolio Selection.” Prior to Markowitz, examination of investment alternatives had been primarily focused on individual assets.
Markowitz’s Nobel Prize-winning work demonstrated that investment classes should not be considered individually. Instead, investors should analyze the combined expected returns and risks of different combinations of asset classes. Markowitz looked at expected returns and risks based on historical data, using volatility as a measure of the “riskiness” of an investment.
Volatility Is Key
Here's a modern example of the type of correlations Markowitz considered: an investment in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and two of its suppliers, such as Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM), might seem like one big investment in the iPhone. However, if the suppliers entered a price war to compete with each other, their margins would shrink and share prices might fall. Apple, on the other hand, would be paying less for its parts and would see an increase in margins (and share price).

Markowitz would consider these intertwined relationships between different investments rather than the individual stocks themselves.

Buffett began investing in BNSF Railway in 2007 and years later offered to acquire the remaining stake in the company Berkshire did not already own.
Berkshire Hathaway announced in 2009 that it would acquire the remaining 77.4% of BNSF for $100 per share. The deal valued the company at $44 billion, including $10 billion in outstanding debt and marked one of the largest acquisitions in Berkshire Hathaway's history.

Interest-rate sensitive mega caps, such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), have gained more than 2% on the day. A weaker greenback, with EUR/USD hitting fresh yearly highs, also supported stock advances. 
Cues From Thursday's Trading: 
Producer price inflation (PPI) decreased by 0.5% in March, falling short of forecasts for a flat monthly reading, while weekly unemployment claims surged by 11,000 to 239,000, above expectations. The two findings signal that a cooling trend in pricing pressures and the labor market is already underway.
Stocks rallied across the board as investors wagered the Federal Reserve will stop raising in June and deliver the first reduction as early as July, according to latest CME Group FedWatch tool.
The S&P 500 index gained 0.7%, returning above 4,100 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average grew 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed, gaining 1.4%. Small caps in the Russell 2000 index were also higher, up 0.9%.

Martin sees Disney as the streaming winner in the longer term, backed by superior marketing skills, lower SAC, strong IP franchises, A+ library titles, and world-class storytellers at Pixar, Lucas Films, and Marvel and ownership of its content studios.

Some of the positive sentiment is attributable to the coordinated action announced by five of the world’s biggest central banks to ease liquidity strains. 
Cues From Past Week’s Trading: 
Stocks closed the week ended March 17 mostly higher despite the volatility seen amid the continuing news flow on the banking crisis. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indices recorded weekly gains of 1.43% and 4.41%, respectively, while the Dow Industrials in which financial stocks have over 15% weighting edged down 0.15%.

The mood in the past week alternated between hope and despair as traders digested the government’s rescue plan to backstop all Silicon Valley Bank  deposits, reports of trouble at First Republic Bank (NYSE: FRC) and, subsequently, the private banks’ rescue package for the bank.
Issues at Credit Suisse AG (NYSE: CS) also simmered through the week, which culminated in a Swiss National Bank-brokered deal to be bought by peer UBS Group Inc. (NYSE: UBS) over the weekend.

Ad Market:  Training data will likely differentiate one LLM from another, and therefore having unique sources of data like Tweets or customer reviews will likely fetch unique responses from the AI model, Munster said. He sees the potential of these LLMs built into the backend of many tech services.
In the long term, this could hurt ad models, as fewer eyeballs at Alpahbet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Search could mean less ad revenue, Munster said.

The Bear case: Potential risks include year-over-year revenue decline in 2023, macro weakness, potential supply chain shortages, longer hardware replacement cycles, slowing services year-over-year growth, and weak China production and/or demand.

Known as the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRKA)(NYSE: BRKB), a conglomerate that is one of the largest companies in the world.
Here’s a look at how Buffett got started with Berkshire Hathaway and how much investing alongside him could have been worth.
What Happened: Buffett is one of the greatest investors of the current generation and is known for a buy-and-hold approach for investing. He also uses that approach in his life, living in the same house for the past 65 years.
Before his buy-and-hold approach used today, Buffett was interested in buying low-priced stocks in the 1960s, including companies that were well-run but trading at low prices.
“If (the stocks) were cheap enough, he didn’t care it was a lousy company and lousy management. He knew he was going to make money anyways because of the cheapness,” Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said in the “Becoming Warren Buffett Documentary,” CNBC reported.
Buffett bought his first shares of textile company Berkshire Hathaway in December 1962 for $7.50 each.
“I bought the first shares of Berkshire in 1962 and it was a northern textile business destined to become extinct eventually,” Buffett said. “It was a statistically ...",0.052,0.88,0.068,0.1655

Powell said the Fed will need to take “into account the totality of incoming data"" to make its decisions. Positive news for the stock market came on Thursday morning when the Labor Department released data showing initial jobless claims increased by 21,000 to 211,000 last week.
The news caused Apple to break up bullishly from an inside bar pattern. An inside bar pattern indicates a period of consolidation and is usually followed by a continuation move in the direction of the trend.

With a hit show returning for a potential last season, the launch of a new sports rights package, and a series with an impressive all-star cast, AppleTV+ could have a big couple of months ahead.
What Happened: The battle for streaming rights to professional sports leagues could be one of the biggest storylines in the streaming sector. Apple secured the rights to Major League Soccer for 10 years, with the deal set to kick off in late February.
The deal will see AppleTV+ become the home of MLS coverage. Apple paid an estimated $2.5 billion for the sports rights in one of its largest streaming bets since launching AppleTV+.
Along with streaming games, Apple is also launching MLS Season Pass, a new subscription service for soccer fans in over 100 countries and regions. The MLS Season Pass has a cost of $99 per season or $79 per season for existing AppleTV+ subscribers. Monthly subscriptions are also available for $14.99 and $12.99, respectively.
The MLS 2023 regular season begins on Feb. 25 and Apple will be at the forefront of the league, which could make the streaming company a big player in the sports space.

What Happened:  Vanguard Group,  BlackRock Institutional Trust Company and State Street Global Advisors hold about 6.85%, 3.6% and 3.13% of Tesla’s outstanding shares, respectively, data shared by Financial Times shows.

A report from Bloomberg cited a complaint by the organizers and said the company fired employees “in retaliation for union activity and to discourage union activity.”
Union Workers United urged the National Labor Relations Board to step in on the matter.
Tesla issued a response Thursday.
“There is a false allegation that Tesla terminated employees in response to a new union campaign,” Tesla said.

Companies are looking for an edge with the release or original shows and movies, live sports and other exclusives.
Here’s a look at the latest from Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) (NASDAQ: PARAA) and how it stacks up to rivals.
What Happened: Paramount Global reported revenue of $8.13 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 2% year-over-year. The company reported direct-to-consumer revenue of $1.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter, Paramount added 9.9 million subscribers for its Paramount+ streaming platform to hit a total of more than 56 million. The company added 10.8 million total global direct-to-consumer subscribers in the fourth quarter to bring the total to 77 million across several platforms.
“Paramount continues to demonstrate the success of its global multiplatform strategy, with popular content at its core. Nowhere was this more evident than in the growth of Paramount+, which added a record 9.9 million subscribers in the fourth quarter,” Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said.
Paramount also announced it will raise the prices of its streaming service as it rebrands to combine with Showtime in the third quarter of 2023. The new platform will be called Paramount+ with Showtime.
“We all know streaming represents incredible value for consumers and the Paramount Plus offering is far from the industry price leader. We are on the value end of the pricing spectrum,” Bakish said on the company’s earnings call.
The fourth quarter report came on the heels of a 13F filing showing that legendary investor Warren Buffett increased the position of Paramount in Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:",0.0,0.93,0.07,0.9517

Benchmark: Kurnos said Roku crushed fourth quarter expectations and provided a first quarter outlook that could have some skepticism.
“We can understand why many of our peers reacted with open skepticism, which we think highlights how far out of favor Roku has fallen,” Kurnos said.
The analyst said it’s hard to argue that Roku didn’t gain market share in the fourth quarter and could have a chance to gain more in the future.
“Roku has a chance, in our view, to prove that they have substantially more value in the ecosystem than most give them credit for.”
Stephens: Zangler called the fourth quarter results a significant beat by Roku.

Cuban is among those sounding the alarm on potential issues with ChatGPT.
“It’s gonna get worse,” Cuban said. “If you play with ChatGPT at all, the next battle isn’t about Twitter, control of Twitter, it’s who controls the AI models and the information that goes in them.”

Dusaniwsky said identifying crowded short and long positions can help investors optimize returns, minimize tail risk drawdowns and balance their portfolios appropriately.
""Concentration, or sentiment risk, has become one of the most important investment factors driving investment returns in today’s market,"" Dusaniwsky said.

The ETFs are launched in partnership with Unusual Whales, which has been covering the unusual stock trading activity of members of Congress for years. Here are the details.
What Happened: In 2022, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) had its worst-performing year since 2008. That didn’t stop 20% of the members of Congress who traded stocks and options from beating the market, a number that is higher than that of professional money managers over time.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has seen increased scrutiny over the trades made by her husband Paul Pelosi, who is a venture capitalist. Many of the trades disclosed by Pelosi have shown questionable timing ahead of new policy changes and bills from Congress. Pelosi has said publicly that she does not share any information with her husband.
The increased calls to ban members of Congress from trading stocks while in office led to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) recently introducing the PELOSI Act, officially called Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act.

PayPal's strong start in 2023 versus the S&P 500 and the analyst's cautious stance over 4Q results led to the re-rating.
While most investors expect initial 2023 revenue growth guidance to come in below the Street, Davis believes the 2023 top-line outlook will imply flat to negative growth for branded checkout, likely resulting in the share loss narrative growing even louder. 
Given new disclosures breaking out TPV by segment and specifically branded checkout and Braintree and unbranded, Davis' math suggests branded checkout likely lost share in 2022.

Earnings By The Numbers

Apple issued earnings per share of $1.88 (10.9% lower year-over-year), missing consensus estimates of $1.94.
The company booked $117.15 billion (down 5.49% year-over-year), missing consensus estimates of $121.1 billion.
Mac revenues came in at $7.74 billion (down 28.66% year-over-year), against estimates of $9.63 billion.
iPad revenues came in at $9.4 billion (up 29.66% year-over-year), against estimates of $7.76 billion.
Gross margins were 42.96%, against the estimated 42.95%.

Morgan Stanley

The investment bank reiterated Apple as its “top buy” for 2023, and left its $175 price target unchanged.
“While we expect the macro environment to remain a year-over-year headwind in the March quarter, revenue growth is expected to improve by 6-7 [percentage] points vs. the December quarter,” Erik Woodring said in a note to investors Friday.

Cues From Friday’s Trading: 
Stocks gap-opened higher on Thursday, capitalizing on positive tech earnings. The major averages then showed divergence, with the Dow Industrials languishing mostly below the unchanged line before closing lower. The S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite hovered above the flat line through the session before closing notably higher.

The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 Indices are now at their highest levels since Aug. 25.
Technology, communication services and consumer discretionary stocks once again led from the front on Thursday, while energy, material and healthcare stocks lost ground in the session.

The Apple Thesis: Apple’s first-quarter iPhone revenue miss reflects roughly eight million to nine million units being pushed out of the December quarter due to supply chain issues and an 800 basis points of forex headwinds, Ives said.
“We believe overall given the supply chain disaster that Apple saw this was better than feared iPhone number and ultimately more of a supply issue than a demand issue,” the analyst said. Apple seemingly is cutting back on some orders around Macs, iPads and AirPods over the coming quarters to reflect a softer consumer backdrop, he noted.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that missed expectations. iPhone revenue trailed forecasts, while strength in Services and iPad helped offset some of the weakness.
How Apple Did On Key Q1 Metrics:  Cupertino, California-based Apple reported first-quarter earnings per share of $1.88, missing the consensus estimate of $1.94 per share and declining from the year-ago EPS of $2.01.
Apple’s top line fell 5% year-over-year to $117.2 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $121.1 billion.
The December quarter, which is Apple’s fiscal first quarter, is also its busiest and seasonally strong quarter. Expectations were muted this time around.
On the fourth-quarter earnings call held in late October, CFO Luca Maestri  said the year-over-year growth in revenue would slow down in the December quarter. He flagged a 10-percentage-point impact from an adverse currency effect, macroeconomic challenges slowing Service sector revenue growth and a substantial decline in Mac revenue due to tougher comparisons.
The first quarter of 2022 benefited from the launch and associated fill of the newly redesigned MacBook Pro with M1 chips. The dollar has weakened since then, amid the Fed’s normalization of rates.

The major averages opened modestly lower and moved sideways until the Fed rate announcement. With the Fed serving a 25 basis point hike, in line with expectations, but hinting at more rate hikes to come, stocks initially reacted negatively and slipped further immediately after the verdict was announced. Following Chair Jerome Powell’s  presser, stocks launched into a rally in late afternoon trading.

Brady previously announced his retirement from the league in February 2022 before deciding one month later that he would return.
Brady said in his retirement video on social media on Wednesday that this time he is stepping away from playing ""for good."" 
Brady was the oldest player in the NFL for the 2022-2023 season. Drafted 199th overall in the 2000 NFL Draft on April 6, 2000, a lot has changed since Brady first entered the league.
Here’s a look at 23 things that weren’t around when Brady joined the NFL.
Cryptocurrency: Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was founded in 2009, following a white paper released the previous year. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is more than $400 billion and one of many cryptocurrencies that are now readily available to trade by consumers, including on the FTX app endorsed by Brady.
Twitter: Social media platform Twitter Inc was founded in March 2006. Brady has 2.8 million followers on the social media platform as of today.
Facebook: Social media platform Facebook, which is owned by Meta Platforms inc (NASDAQ: META), was founded in 2004, two years after Brady joined the NFL.
Instagram: Photo and video sharing social media platform Instagram, which is owned by Meta Platforms, launched in 2010. Brady has more than 13 million followers on Instagram, but trails his ex-wife, model Gisele Bundchen at 20.5 million.
iPhone: Now one of the most popular smartphones in the world, the iPhone wasn’t launched until 2007 by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Brady couldn’t own an iPhone until his eighth season in the NFL.
Netflix Streaming: Now used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, the ability to stream movies and television shows from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) wasn’t a reality when Brady joined the league. Netflix launched in 1998 as a DVD by mail service and would later add streaming in 2007.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is releasing its fourth-quarter financial report after the close Thursday. Here’s what investors need to know ahead of the print. 
The consensus estimate for Amazon’s fourth-quarter revenue is $145 billion, in line with the e-commerce giant’s recent guidance. Amazon said during its third-quarter call in October that it expected fourth-quarter revenue to be between $140 billion and $148 billion, equating to year-over-year growth of between 2% to 8%.
The company made headlines on Tuesday for illegally resisting unionization efforts by its employees, as per a National Labor Relations Board judge.
Markets have been responding positively in anticipation of the call, with the company's stock gaining almost 20% in the last month and 4.6% in the last five days.
Hard Times Ahead For Big Tech?
On Monday, Barclays analyst Ross Sandler cut the price target for Amazon from $140 to $130 and maintained an Overweight rating.

Several critical darlings received numerous nominations and many of the top nominated movies from the recent Golden Globes awards show also heard their names called again.
Two of the big questions from the nominations centered around the awards success of movies on streaming platforms and big box office movies.
The 95th Academy Awards will air on ABC on March 12.
Can Netflix Win The Big Award?: Streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) had been an award favorite in recent years, and at the Golden Globes it recently won three awards from its 14 nominations.
Netflix was once again nominated for top honors in the Best Picture category with its “All Quiet on the Western Front,” a movie it acquired the rights to in 2020.
The anti-war German film is an adaptation of a 1929 novel and was also the subject of the award-winning 1930 film of the same name, which took home the Best Picture that year.
Netflix's “All Quiet on the Western Front” received nine total nominations, ranking as the second most nominated movie behind only the 10 for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”
Netflix received a total of 15 nominations, which was among the best for streaming companies. Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) had 22 total nominations, including 12 for titles related to its Disney+ streaming platform.

What Happened: On Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2022, the best of movies and television were honored in a broadcast on NBC and Peacock, both units of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA). The awards show had a strong presence from streaming companies, with several among the most nominated.
Two of the big winners came with ties to The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS). “Abbott Elementary,” which airs on ABC, won the Best Comedy television award. “The Banshees of Inisherin,” which came from Searchlight Pictures, won Best Picture for movies in the musical or comedy category.
Disney unit Marvel also set a record with actress Angela Bassett becoming the first Marvel actor to win a Golden Globe for their role. Marvel has had huge box office success with $11.1 billion in the domestic box office, but has been shut out of many awards shows. Bassett’s win was one of the few awards for any of the top-grossing movies of 2022.

For the fourth time in four years, the jackpot on the Mega Millions lottery drawing has topped the $1 billion mark.
Here’s a look at the historic jackpot and what you could buy with the after-tax lump sum winnings.
What Happened: The Mega Millions drawing on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2023, is currently listed at $1.1 billion, which is the third-largest jackpot in the game’s history.
The $1.1 billion jackpot trails only the $1.537 billion won in 2018 and the $1.337 billion won in July 2022.
Tickets cost $2 to play with an additional $1 option cost for a multiplier that raises the nonjackpot winning payouts.
Five white balls are drawn numbered 1 to 70 and a gold Mega Ball numbered 1 to 25 is drawn. A person has to match all six to win the overall jackpot.
Players can select their own numbers for their tickets, with lucky numbers, birthdays and anniversaries often among the favorite selections. Players can also receive random numbers by selecting an easy pick/quick pick.
The overall odds to win the jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350. The odds to win a prize of at least $4 are 1 in 24.
If no one matched all six balls Tuesday night, the jackpot will increase ahead of a drawing on Friday, Jan. 13, 2022.
How Much Do You Win?: The jackpot for Tuesday’s drawing stands at $1.1 billion with a listed cash payment of $568.7 million.
The jackpot is paid out over a 30-year period with an initial payment upon winning and an annual payment for the next 29 years. Each annual payment goes up by 5% to attempt to offset inflation.
Given the current high inflation era that we are in, a person who wins the jackpot is immediately tasked with choosing whether they want all the money upfront or to be paid annually and if they think the 5% is enough to offset ...",0.006,0.853,0.141,0.9935

On Monday, the market squandered the morning session's gains and declined through the afternoon to close on a mixed note. Selling set in as traders sifted through the comments of two Fed officials. The broader S&P 500 Index, which was up a little over 1.5% points in early afternoon trading, gave back all the gains thereafter and ended marginally lower.
Technology, consumer discretionary, material and utility stocks saw marked strength, while consumer staple and healthcare stocks came under selling pressure.

The report broke down unusual trading activity from members of Congress and also showed the members who beat the returns of the S&P 500.
Here are the highlights of the report.
What Happened: The year 2022 was the worst for the S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY), since 2008.
Despite the bad returns for the overall market, 26 members of Congress beat the S&P 500 with their 2022 return, according to a new detailed report from Unusual Whales.
In 2022, 131 members of Congress filed stock and options trading disclosures. This figure was down from 147 members in 2021. The report tracked $788 million in trades from more than 12,700 transactions. The number of transactions was similar to 2021, with around $189 million less traded in 2022 than the previous year.
The report found House Republicans had more than 1,000 fewer trades in 2022. House Democrats had over 1,000 more trades in 2022 compared to the previous year.
Democrats saw an average return of -1.76% and Republicans saw an average return of 0.4%, both beating the -18% return of the S&P 500 in 2022.
Over the past 10 years, about 10% of fund managers outperformed the S&P 500, according to SPIVA data, while in 2022, about 5% of total Congress outperformed.
When just comparing the Congressional members who traded — just 131 of the possible 535 — 26 beat the market. That equates to 20%, a much higher rate than professional money managers over time.
Here were the top 10 members of Congress by 2022 return, according to the report:

The sell-off has been all-pervasive, with stocks, bonds and cryptos all selling off indiscriminately. Even as high-fliers like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) bit the dust, there were a few that stood towering tall, defying the macro and geopolitical challenges.
See Also: Best Depression Stocks
Here's Benzinga’s list of best-performing stocks screened based on a few criteria:
1. Target Hospitality Corp. (NASDAQ: TH)
YTD Gains:  +310%
Target Hospitality, founded in 1978, provides cost-effective and customized specialty rental accommodations, culinary services and hospitality solutions for end markets, including oil, gas, energy infrastructure and the government. The Woodland, Texas-based company’s third-quarter results revealed 79% revenue growth and 125% adjusted EBITDA growth. The stock got a solid lift in July following the release of its second-quarter results, in which it upwardly revised its revenue guidance.
After a consolidation move, the stock legged up again, reacting to the third-quarter results.
The average analysts’ price target, compiled by TipRanks, is $20.67, suggesting roughly 42% upside potential on top of the stellar run for the year.
2. Amplify Energy Corp. (NYSE: AMPY)
YTD Gains:  +188%
Houston, Texas-based Amplify Energy is an independent oil and natural gas company. The stock’s rally that began at the start of 2022 continued unhindered through the middle of the year, coinciding with oil’s rally. Subsequently, the stock was locked in a broad sideways move, as oil’s rally lost steam.
Given crude oil prices could stay high amid supply constraints and forecasts for higher demand, the stock could be in for further upside from current levels.
3. Prometheus Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ: RXDX)
YTD Gains:  +175%
Prometheus is a clinical-stage biotech based out of San Diego, California, and it focuses on developing therapeutics and companion diagnostic products for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. The company went public in early 2021 and its shares were listed on the Nasdaq in March 2021.
The bulk of the gains made this year came in early December, as the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",0.041,0.854,0.105,0.9485

What Happened: The Netflix movie “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” featured a character that might resemble Musk and be related to his acquisition of social media platform Twitter.
The character Miles Bron is a technology billionaire who has interests in space exploration and automotives, two sectors Musk had disrupted in real life. Played by Edward Norton in the movie, Bron was portrayed as someone who stole ideas and took credit for items he wasn’t behind.
Movie director Rian Johnson recently shared with Wired that Musk might have been an inspiration for the character.
Johnson told Wired he wrote the screenplay during COVID-19 lockdowns, prior to Musk announcing plans to purchase Twitter. The movie director joked he didn’t know about this ahead of time, but viewers could see parallels between the behavior of the tech billionaires both fictional and in real life.

With 2022 coming to a close, the much-anticipated ""Santa Claus rally"" period is now underway, as the markets were muted ahead of Christmas. The year's final full week of trading resulted in the S&P 500 finishing 0.20% lower, the Nasdaq Composite dropping by 1.94%, and the Dow nudging 0.86% higher to end the week.
On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported the personal consumption expenditures price index increased by 5.5% year-over-year in the month of November, down from 6.1% in October. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up 4.7%, in line with analyst estimates.
Benzinga continues to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look.

This week, S3 Partners released an updated report on the most profitable stocks of the year for short sellers, and Tesla leads the way by leaps and bounds.
S3 estimates Tesla short sellers had generated $15 billion in profits in 2022 through Dec. 21, which does not include Tesla's nearly 9% decline on Thursday.
Tesla's stock price is down 69.5% year-to-date in 2022, and the selling pressure has intensified in the last two months as investors fear financial fallout from Tesla CEO Elon Musk's chaotic $44-billion takeover of Twitter and a potential slowdown in EV demand.

Musk himself contributed to the selling pressure in Tesla in November when he sold $4 billion of Tesla stock, but Musk said Thursday that he is not selling any more shares until at least 2024.

Overall, 2022 was a very tough year for the stock market. As of this writing, the S&P 500 has returned -17%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is -7% and the Nasdaq leads the year in losses with a return of nearly -30%. Once-reliable mega-cap technology darlings like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have seen a stunning fall from grace in 2022. Apple is down 21% YTD, Amazon has dropped nearly 45% and Google has declined over 34% through the first eleven months of 2022.
However, not all stocks have fallen prey to the market’s “doom and gloom” mentality. Asure Software (NASDAQ: ASUR) is one stock that has rebounded after a tough start to 2022 and is now posting a positive gain for 2022, as of this writing. Given the company's strong recent third-quarter 2022 financial results and its continuation of impressive growth, Asure is bucking the overall market and outperforming major indices, as the company’s business model thrives in the current economic environment. 
Asure Software Thriving Amid Current Economic Environment
Asure’s suite of SaaS solutions helps provide comprehensive back-office support for small and medium businesses (SMBs). These services help to streamline important operations such as HR, payroll, employment benefits, taxes, and more, which helps SMBs to cut costs and save money. Not to mention, Asure’s services can help SMBs be more effective in competing for top employee talent, as it allows SMBs to offer enticing employment benefits typically offered by larger businesses.
Furthermore, Asure has continued to build relationships with other firms to help bolster its services. Equifax (NYSE: EFX) and its Work Number services help clients quickly verify income and employment history. Asure has also linked up with PrismHR to boost its payroll tax management services and its FlexTax platform. This allows Asure to market its FlexTax platform to PrismHR’s 80,000 registered client base.

In recent months, Asure has worked closely with its CPA partners to help develop new technologies to help streamline the demand for Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) filings. This helps CPAs and back office workers to streamline the ERTC filing process and focus on higher-value client work instead.
Another major milestone for Asure was its recent expansion of 401(k) plan operations for SMBs. By adding 80+ retirement provider integrations, Asure provides SMBs with the tools to help attract higher-quality employees by offering more comprehensive retirement benefits. The added integrations are compatible with Asure’s payroll system, which helps to streamline enrollment, reduce dual entry and ensure compliance.
Throughout 2022, analysts covering Asure stood fast and did not succumb to downgrades. After following the company’s immaculate rebound during the second half of 2022, Asure’s analysts are stepping up ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",0.023,0.786,0.191,0.9977

(NASDAQ: AAPL) on Monday for pausing most of the ads on the social media platform.
What Happened: Musk even questioned Apple's commitment to free speech. But it appears that his outbursts have not gone down well even with his staunchest supporters.
Tesla bulls Gary Black  of Future Fund and Ross Gerber  of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth And Investment Management did not take kindly to Musk’s comments.
Gerber reminded Musk about his “tiff” with Apple in the past. The Tesla CEO had previously criticized the 30% app store fee Apple levies, calling it a “tax on internet.” Musk himself confessed in 2020 that he had sought an appointment with Apple CEO Tim Cook  in 2018 when Tesla was on the brink to discuss a potential sale to the tech giant, but Cook promptly turned down the request.
Gerber also took a dig at Apple for pulling back ads amid a challenging environment. 
Seems like a bad time for apple and @tim_cook to be making any moralistic stand. Considering the horrific conditions in their factory has started riots across china... This is a lose/lose position from Apple... $AAPL #twitter

When insiders sell shares, it indicates their concern in the company’s prospects or that they view the stock as being overpriced. Either way, this signals an opportunity to go short on the stock. Insider sales should not be taken as the only indicator for making an investment or trading decision. At best, it can lend conviction to a selling decision.

And the few-and-far-between upsides have proved to be bear market rallies and not those signaling a sustainable uptrend.
What Happened: Against this backdrop, a prominent Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) analyst said a reversal is contingent on the materialization of three events — a Fed pause, resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war and China ending its lockdowns.
Three factors could set off a bull market rally, said Ross Berger, co-founder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management.
If these materialize, investors can brace for a much higher stock market in 2023, he added.

The index futures are pointing to a modestly higher opening on Friday. The yield on the benchmark Treasury note has pulled back sharply to a seven-week low on Friday in reaction to the dovish message relayed by the minutes.
The major averages advanced on Wednesday as investors construed the FOMC minutes as hinting at a slowdown in the pace of fed funds rate hikes. The Dow Industrials and the S&P 500 Index closed at their highest levels in about three months. Wall Street remained closed on Thursday in observance of the Thanksgiving holiday.

The Apple Thesis:  The iPhone 14 demand is way ahead of supply, potentially causing major shortages leading into the Christmas season, Ives said in a note. The COVID-19 China shutdowns at Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Manufacturing Company Limited (OTC: HNHPF) have been a “gut punch” to Apple in the December quarter, the analyst said.

Here's the latest:

Since Elon Musk took the helm at Twitter, about half the company’s workforce was laid off.
Twitter founder Jack Dorsey took part of the blame for overgrowing the company at times of financial tailwinds.
Meta (NASDAQ: META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a similar sentiment in a letter where he announced the firing of 11,000 employees — 13% of the company’s global staff.
Earlier this month, Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) decided to remove 13% of employees from its payroll.
Digital payments giant Stripe cut 14% of its workforce.
In August, ​​1,300 of a total of 6,400 Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) employees were shown the door.
In July, Shopify shut down 10% of its workforce.
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is expected to let go over 10,000 employees (it froze new hires at least until 2023)
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is also reportedly on a hiring freeze.

These are just a few examples of a trend that is reaching far more than the best-known names in tech. Layoffs.fiy, a site that has been tracking layoffs in the tech industry since the start of the pandemic, has registered 136,989 layoffs from 849 companies in 2022 alone.
Indeed, the press and public opinion made the topic a central narrative for the second half of 2022, but hard data shows that the issue is sector-specific, and the U.S. job market remains strong.

Monday’s economic calendar is light and doesn’t boast of any major market-moving data or reports. Traders could show apprehension ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections and the consumer price inflation report due on Thursday.
Stocks closed the week ended Nov. 5 on a downbeat note, with technology stocks serving as drags on the overall market. The weekly losses reflected trader reaction to the Federal Reserve’s 75 basis point rate hike as well as hawkish commentary by Chair Jerome Powell at the press conference, mixed earnings news flow and the strong October jobs data. Nevertheless, stocks ended the week on a firmer footing.

Robinhood had a solid third quarter, and the company said on its earnings call that its customer base of retail traders also outperformed in the third quarter as well.
Robinhood investors are hoping the stock has finally stopped the bleeding after losing more than two-thirds of its value in the last 12 months. Robinhood's business boomed in 2021 during a period of market mania for meme stocks and cryptocurrencies.
Yet investors have dumped risk assets in 2022 as the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates.
As a result, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) prices are down 57.1% and 58.7% year-to-date, respectively. Popular meme stocks GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) are also down 31.3% and 79.9%, respectively.

According to Ironhold Capital founder and chief investment officer Siddharth Singhai, Meta is a buy, and here’s why.

“The fundamental problems [for Meta], in my view, are nonexistent. If you examine the fundamentals, the company [is doing] better than it was last year; the only thing that has changed is advertising demand has fallen off, but the same has happened for Google as well.

TikTok recently announced the expansion of its universe with the inclusion of an exclusive section for video games.
The app that revolutionized the mobile video market now aims to repeat its success in the field of mobile games, albeit without neglecting its main offering.
ByteDance, the company that owns the platform, has not yet confirmed when the video game catalog will be available on the social network. As reported by the Financial Times, the official announcement should arrive in the next week.
According to the British media outlet, these games would be integrated into the existing TikTok app, so users would not have to download an additional component to access this functionality. Instead, a new exclusive tab would be added to the app.

The major U.S. averages closed Thursday’s session on a mixed note, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indices declining sharply, while the Dow Industrials bucked the downtrend. While earnings reports from a couple of Dow components propped up the blue-chip average, earnings also proved to be the undoing of the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.
Traders also reacted to advance third-quarter GDP report, which showed quicker-than-expected growth.
“The U.S. is not currently in recession, given the strength of the consumer sector,” Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial said. Excluding more volatile categories, the growth trajectory looks weak, he added.
“A deteriorating housing market and nagging inflation along with an aggressive Federal Reserve put the economy on unsure footing for 2023,” the economist said, adding that the markets have possibly priced in much of the near-term recession risks.

During recessions, blue chip dividend stocks with strong fundamentals tend to fare well compared to growth investments.
Another relatively safe investment is U.S. treasury yields which will most likely continue to rise throughout the end of the year as the Fed has two meetings left. The Fed could hike interest rates in its November and December meetings as it has not seen inflation drop at a steady pace.
All three of these ETFs are down year-to-date but could offer an attractive buy to hedge against inflation and a looming recession.

(NYSE: SNAP) shares tumbled about 27% following the release of its third-quarter results.
What Went Wrong At Snap: Four headwinds — ad market softness, monetization method, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) privacy changes and competition from TikTok — have worked in unison, weighing down the Snapchat parent’s topline growth, Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Funds, said.
The analyst noted that Snap's revenue growth has slowed from 38% in the March quarter to 13% in the June quarter and 7% in the September quarter. The stock has priced in negative revenue growth for the March quarter, he added.

(NASDAQ: SNAP) is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday after the market closes. The company is coming off two tough quarters and the resultant sharp pullback in shares.
Snap’s earnings could give a foretaste of what to expect from ad-dependent social media platforms such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR), Pinterest Inc. (NYSE: PIN) and potentially Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).
Key Metrics To Watch:  Analysts, on average, expect Snap to report a loss of one cent per share for the third quarter, with estimates ranging between a loss of 10 cents and a profit of seven cents, according to Benzinga Pro data.
The consensus estimate models revenue of $1.14 billion for the quarter, up 6.5% from the $1.07 billion reported a year ago and almost flat with the previous quarter’s $1.111 billion.

The company shied away from giving guidance for the quarter when it reported its second-quarter results, citing uncertainties, but hinted revenue will likely be sequentially flat. Later, in late August, in an investor presentation, it said year-over-year revenue growth through Aug. 29 was at 8%.
Snap missed Street expectations in the previous two quarters, with the shares plunging about 40% following its second-quarter results.

What Happened? On Friday, the Commerce Department announced a new set of export controls aimed at protecting U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. In addition to restricting U.S. sales of semiconductor technology to China, the new rules also require foreign companies to license American tools used to produce high-end chips sold to China.
“Such practice runs counter to the principle of fair competition and international trade rules,” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Mao Ning said in response to the new measures. As of now, China has not announced plans for any potential retaliatory measures.

Those games, like many before them, could see strong viewership due to a home run chase happening with the team's star player.
What Happened: Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge has hit 60 home runs on the season as of Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2022. The slugger has the lead for home runs in the American League and across all of Major League Baseball.
The next home run hit by Judge, if he hits another, would tie him with Roger Maris for the single-season American League record. Hitting 62 home runs would be the American League record and could also be considered the Major League record by some, as the records set by Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds come into question due to their links to steroid use.
Trying to make history, the home run chase from Judge has led to increased viewership of Yankees games, which could benefit several media partners along with the team's own broadcasting platform.

With prices soaring due to high levels of inflation — at 8.3% for August— some consumers have turned to credit cards in an effort to complement their increasingly limited budgets, while many are struggling to make payments.
Credit card issuing in the U.S. is rising. By the first quarter of this year, Americans held 537 million credit card accounts, up 6% from the previous year.
Credit card debt came down from an all-time high of $930 billion in late 2019, according to New York Fed data, but the average credit card holder in the U.S. still had $5,769 in credit card debt by the first quarter of 2022, with balances only slightly below pre-pandemic levels, according to MoneyGeek.

What Happened: Apple is now the most shorted stock in the public markets by dollars, according to a report from S3 Partners.
Apple has $18.44 billion in shares short. The total now passes the previous record holder, electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA). According to the report, Tesla has $17.44 billion in shares short.
“Tesla has held the top spot in the short interest league tables for 864 days, almost two and a half years since April 2020, but Apple has recently recaptured the crown,” S3 Partners Managing Director Ihor Dusaniwsky said.

The games broadcast on Thursday, Sunday and Monday posted strong viewership figures. Here’s a look at the numbers and the companies behind the big figures.
What Happened: Viewership for the first week of NFL games was up compared to the first week of 2021, which could be a good sign for the companies spending billions of dollars on streaming rights.
NFL games in the first week averaged 18.5 million viewers, up 3% from last season’s first week. This marked the best start to an NFL season since 2016, according to Front Office Sports.
More than 121 million people watched NFL games in the first week, a figure that was up 5% from the previous year. On Sunday, around 83 million people watched NFL games.
“As the viewership numbers would indicate, our fans are obviously excited to have the NFL back,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.
NBC, owned by Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA), aired the first week’s Sunday Night Football contest with a matchup between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Dallas Cowboys. The game had more than 21 million viewers according to the company, marking the best Sunday Night Football opener since 2015.
NBC also aired the first week’s Thursday Night Football game, which saw the Buffalo Bills beat the Los Angeles Rams.

These past few months have been good to them though, and heading into the last quarter of the year they're up about 35% from the multi-year lows they hit in May and June. This kind of multi-month plummet may have ruled them out from ever again being compared to the likes of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), as they were when included in the FAANG group, but that's not to say there still isn't an opportunity for retail investors to capitalize. 
Recent comments from Morgan Stanley, though not overwhelmingly bullish, were decidedly not bearish, and this can often be the first sign that a trend reversal is in the making. Just last week the team there reiterated their Equal Weight rating Netflix shares, saying they seem to be trading around fair value right now, though some concerns remain about whether the company can achieve their 2023 subscriber goals. It's been not only the sharp slowdown in these subscriber numbers, but the actual decline of them that's fuelled much of the selling over the past year.

The disappointing unveiling led to Apple's stock retreating during market hours by close to 1%. Meanwhile, Apple is down close to 4% during Tuesday's trading hours, as a hotter than expected inflation weighed on the markets.
The iPhone 14 has been priced at $799, meanwhile, the iPhone 13 has been discounted to $699. Apple killed the iPhone mini, and instead now has two main models a 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and 6.7 inches iPhone 14 plus. Apple has introduced a number of new features for the latest phone including the addition of satellite connection capabilities, the addition of eSim capabilities, 8k video capture, and the new A16 chips. Apple's fans won't be overly impressed, but considering the stickiness of the product, expect the phone to continue dominating sales.

Growth stocks are any share in a company that is expected to grow at a rate significantly higher than the average market growth. Historically, they perform best when interest rates are falling and company earnings are on the rise. However, they become vulnerable when the economy begins to decline and the cheap money that can fuels fast growth becomes more difficult to find. 
But despite the current state of economies, many growth companies managed to prosper and made it through various economic hurdles that the past two years presented. Case in point, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) saw its stock price grow 65% from 2020 to 2021 to $2,008.72 from $3,313 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fire & Ice: Part Deux
Recall earlier this month when the S&P 500 index extended its losses to three straight weeks? Wilson, a Morgan Stanley equity strategist, blamed the Federal Reserve.
“With the Fed emphatically dashing hopes for a dovish pivot, we think that asset markets may be entering 'fire and ice part deux,'"" he said.
In contrast to part one, the decline in stocks would come mostly via a higher equity risk premium and lower earnings, Wilson added. He also correctly predicted that the decline in S&P 500 earnings was far from over.
“In short, part deux will be more icy than fiery,"" he said. ""The opposite of 1H22.”

Here’s what analysts think of the updates and what it could mean for the future of the technology giant.
The Apple Analysts: Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring had an Overweight rating and a price target of $180.
Needham analyst Laura Martin had a Buy rating and a price target of $170.
KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh had an Overweight rating and a price target of $185.

The Analyst Takeaways: Morgan Stanley's Woodring said the event met expectations and the big focus will now be on what demand there is for the iPhone 14.
“The later launch of the iPhone 14 Plus was a small surprise,” Woodring said. “Our focus now turns to early demand data points, including iPhone lead times.”
The analyst noted pricing was in line with estimates and Apple was working on updating items such as battery, display and camera, above others, as they were what consumers cared the most about.
Woodring believed that Apple will ship 51 million iPhones in the September quarter, with the delay of the iPhone Plus not having a large impact.

When The Bank Error Is Not In Your Favor: Pay Back $500 Million

Citigroup Inc   (NASDAQ:   C) has won an appeal to retrieve $500 million that was sent accidentally in 2020 to a group of   Revlon Inc   (NYSE: REV) creditors.
In August 2020, Citi accidentally sent $900 million to a group of Revlon creditors. The actual operation involved sending interest payments to Revlon creditors, but instead, the bank sent out a payment for the entire loan.   
Some creditors returned the mistaken sum for about $400 million, but others refused, citing a ""discharge for value"" defense.

The “Oracle of Omaha” turns 92 today and has lived through 10 decades.
Buffett has been one of the greatest investors of the last six decades and remains the active chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B). This article will showcase a highlight from each decade of Buffett’s personal and investment career.
1930: Warren Buffett was born Aug. 30, 1930. His father Howard was a former stockbroker, which would have a huge influence on Buffett’s decision to get involved with the business.
1940: Buffett purchased his first stock at the age of 11. The purchase was for three shares of Cities Service Preferred, a natural gas company. Buffett bought the shares at $38 only to see them soon drop to $27 each. He waited until they hit $40 to sell for a profit. Shares later hit $200 each, which Buffett has since cited as a lesson on patience in investing.
1950: Despite his growing wealth, Buffett has lived in the same house in Nebraska, Omaha since 1958. The home was purchased for $31,500. Adjusted for inflation, that would be the equivalent of over $280,000 today.
1960: By the year 1965, Buffett had assumed control of textiles company Berkshire Hathaway thanks to acquiring 49%. He ...",0.027,0.856,0.116,0.9599

The Fed issued an aggressive 75-basis point rate hike in June, it issued an additional 75-basis point rate hike in July and is considering a third rate hike in September.

Barnum imported the Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind and arranged for her name and likeness to be associated with a wide range of products including clothing, furniture and pianos.
Into the 20th century, the increased power of print and broadcast media and a greater public fixation on celebrities let more companies recruit performers and athletes as spokespersons for their brands.
Sometimes, very popular celebrities spokespersons overstay their welcome or get tripped up by extraordinary circumstances. General Electric (NYSE: GE) dropped Ronald Reagan as its spokesperson when his personal appearances on behalf of the company veered away from product hype to political messaging; a similar situation derailed Anita Bryant's long run as the celebrity spokesperson for Florida's orange juice industry. O.J. Simpson and Bill Cosby were popular favorites for their respective long-running advertisements for Hertz Global Holdings' (OTC: HTZGQ) rental car service and Kraft Heinz Company's (NASDAQ: KHC) Jell-O puddings, respectively, but today they are not quite beloved by the public.
But on occasion, companies pick the wrong celebrities to promote their brands. Here is a quintet of stars whose salesmanship efforts went hopelessly awry, with astonishing results.
Madonna for Pepsi. In March 1989, Madonna was the hottest star in the music industry when PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) signed her to appear in a television commercial. The spot, dubbed “Make a Wish,” served the dual purpose of promoting Pepsi while offering a preview of the singer’s upcoming hit song, “Like a Prayer.”

The two-minute commercial aired during an episode of “The Cosby Show” and was a relatively benign affair, intercutting scenes from the “Like a Prayer” music video with quick shots of the Pepsi product and logo. However, Madonna coyly told Rolling Stone that “the treatment for the video is a lot more controversial. It’s probably going to touch a lot of nerves in a lot of people.”
And how! The “Like a Prayer” music video was released the day after the commercial aired, complete with raw and visceral blending of sexual and religious imagery that created seismic outrage stretching from the Bible Belt — the right-wing American Family Association called for a PepsiCo boycott — to the Vatican — Pope John Paul II demanded the music video be banned from Italian television.
While PepsiCo had nothing to do with the music video, the company quickly ...",0.077,0.859,0.064,-0.8838

The installed base of active devices once again hit a record, underlining the company’s strong product traction despite the economic uncertainties. Margins slipped sequentially, reflecting the supply chain challenges.
Apple’s Key Q3 Numbers:  Apple’s third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.20, down from $1.30 per share a year ago. Sequentially, the bottom line fell about 21% from the June quarter’s $1.52.
Revenue rose 2% year-over-year but fell about 14.7% quarter-over-quarter to $83 billion. The year-over-year growth tapered off to the slowest pace of growth since 2020 but marked a record revenue performance for the June quarter.
Analysts, on average, estimated EPS of $1.16 on revenue of $82.6 billion.
Third-quarter gross margin was at 43.3%, flat with the year-ago period. The metric, however, contracted from the previous quarter’s 43.7%.
Ahead of the earnings report, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said Cupertino’s problems go beyond the economy. He flagged supply-chain challenges, tougher comparisons and the delay in the availability of the latest MacBook Pro as potential deterrents.

That’s not necessarily the right thing to do, explains Herb founder and CEO Matt Gray whose mission is to pay it forward and inspire 10 million entrepreneurs to live their dreams.
Amidst a slowing economy, Gray urged entrepreneurs to recognize their venture is a marathon and, in order to speed up, they should consider “slowing down and taking better care of themselves and those around them.”

The Google Of Weed: Over the course of nearly a decade, Gray and a small team of up to 50 grew Herb to a community of 41 million loyal fans, all raving for what is 31,000 published pieces of cannabis-focused content.
Gray practices what he preaches. For those years Herb has operated, it has only published, consistently, 12 pieces of content a day on culture, education, “and everything in between.”
Now, some may wonder how this endeavor makes money? That’s simple, Gray says: “When you’re ...",0.055,0.83,0.116,0.9685

Commenting on the development, Munster said it is becoming clear that most companies are bracing for a letup and expects companies to issue cautionary September-quarter guidance.
The analyst also delved into whether negative guidance for that quarter is priced in.

During the Walt Disney Co.’s (NYSE: DIS) fiscal year, first quarter earnings call, CEO Bob Chapek was asked a question by Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) analyst Jason Bazinet on whether he viewed the metaverse as a strategic endeavor that is “going to become potentially a more important piece of your core competency going forward.”
Chapek responded to Bazinet’s inquiry by declaring, “This is a very top of mind thing for us because we are continuing over time to augment our skills and the types of people that we attract into the Walt Disney Co. to reflect the aggressive and ambitious technology agenda that we have. You probably notice that one of my three pillars is innovation and specifically technological innovation because we realize that this is going to be an important part of telling a story in that third dimension, that lean forward interactive dimension. So, it is absolutely top of mind.”
But in the fiscal year, second-quarter earnings call featuring Chapek that was conducted on May 11, no question was raised concerning the metaverse and no information was volunteered by Chapek on what progress was made by Disney in this area since the earlier call.
And the word metaverse was nowhere to be found in the company’s fiscal year, second-quarter earnings report — nor, for that matter, were the words non-fungible tokens or NFTs.
This absence is curious, given Chapek’s advocacy of “technological innovation” in his fiscal year, first-quarter earnings call and his enthusiasm for the subject in a Fortune interview from January. But that’s not to say Disney has retreated from the digital environments of NFTs and the metaverse — it’s just that the company’s forward movement is occurring at a somewhat leisurely pace.

In Search Of Disney: Rebekah Barton, senior entertainment editor for the Inside the Magic blog that focuses on all things Disney, recalled being intrigued on the February earnings call, although she wondered why there was no depth to Chapek’s pronouncement.
“It was sort of intriguing because it was like they were trying to stay ahead of the curve,” she recalled. “But there wasn't a lot of concrete detail given. Whether that's because they simply weren't ready to share or because it's actually not ready, I can't know.”
Chapek’s lack of detail was on display earlier in a January interview with Fortune where he spoke enthusiastically — if vaguely — about the subject.
“The precursor to everything we’re talking about with the metaverse and this customer-personalized blending of physical and digital is the database,” said Chapek, who viewed data mining as his key to success.
“We’ve been collecting very deep, rich data for a long time from our parks. When you sign on to Disney+, we know who you are. We’ve got volumes of hard data that tell us exactly what were the first streams, when did the first streams come on, how long did people watch, how many times did they watch?

That would be the biggest Macbook Air released so far — even bigger than the smallest Macbook Pro model (14-inch) and just an inch less than the largest Pro.

On June 14, multiple business news outlets carried variations of the headline “Disney Loses Streaming Rights for Indian Premier League Cricket.” The coverage within these outlets detailed how a consortium that included Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARAA)(NASDAQ: PARA) outbid current rights owner, the Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS), by paying $2.6 billion for the Indian subcontinent streaming rights to the IPL cricket tournament for 2023 through 2027, with many observers insisting this was a misstep for Disney.
These same observers declined to fixate on the fact Disney secured the television rights to broadcast the matches in the Indian subcontinent from 2023 to 2027 for $3 billion, and most of them failed to emphasize that Disney was not aggressively focused on retaining the streaming rights.
In many ways, this epitomizes the problem in trying to determine how Disney competes against its rivals. The company has a history of inventing new playing fields and quickly dominating fields created by others.
But will the current environment demand a bold new game plan for a company that is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year?
From Game-Changer To Game-Usurper: Disney holds the distinction of being the only studio from Hollywood’s Golden Age that was never gobbled up by conglomerates or investors — although it did fend off an unwelcome hostile takeover bid in 1984.
In the years when Walt Disney was in charge, the company created new environments by bringing sounding to cartoons and then stretching the animated shorts into feature-length films. Disney established the nature documentary as a genre within non-fiction filmmaking and embraced television in the 1950s when other studios viewed the medium as a menace.
Disney was not the first film producer to explore product merchandising, but he went forth with an audacity and success rate that was without precedent. The company’s expansion into theme parks and the travel and hospitality sector was also groundbreaking for an entertainment company.
In the years that followed Walt Disney’s passing in 1967, the company would never be the bold entity to create new opportunities. For example, Disney was not the first studio to explore the potential of videocassettes in the home entertainment market — 20th Century Fox began licensing their films to the Magnetic Video label in 1977, with Disney following suit later in the decade by licensing some of their titles to DiscoVision for the ill-fated LaserDisc format.
Disney was also later than other companies in arriving on the Internet (Disney.com turned up in 1996), in the cable television market (Disney Channel went on the air in 1983), in the app world (DisneyNow debuted in 2017) and in the streaming sector (Disney+ premiered in 2019).
While it quickly played catch-up to take prominence in those spaces, sometimes its tardiness came with a price: in its second-quarter 2022 earnings report, the company acknowledged that it paid more than $1 billion to “a customer to early terminate license agreements for film and television content delivered in previous years.” In translation, it meant it had to fork over a lot of money to regain properties it licensed before getting around to start Disney+.

Still In The Race: Disney’s prominence in the current entertainment industry has its foundation in four key acquisitions during Bob Iger’s term as chief executive: the purchases of Pixar in 2006, Marvel Entertainment in 2009, Lucasfilm in 2012 and 21st Century Fox in 2019. With these acquisitions, the company bulked up its portfolio with a surplus of audience-favorite material that was effectively dispatched to the company’s various platforms and sectors.
In 2021, Disney had four of the year’s top 10 grossing films, more than any studio, with three of the films — “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the 10 Rings,” “Black Widow” ...",0.038,0.871,0.091,0.9899

However, one such project that has been in the works for more than 25 years will soon come to fruition.
What Happened: According to Stereoscopic Displays and VR Systems III Preface, Apple demonstrated a wearable computer prototype with a head-mounted display as far back as 1996. And in an Apple Research report titled ""Volumetric Hyper Reality, A Computer Graphics Holy Grail for the 21st Century?,"" it's evident that the company has explored hyper-reality and environmental feedback displays as far back as 1995.

Today, Apple boasts a massive augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) research unit with hundreds of employees. The company has also acquired tons of companies over the years in an effort to become a major player in the AR/VR space. 
As a result, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant is now on the verge of debuting at least two separate product lines that could shake up this segment. The first device will be a VR visor with AR features expected to launch as soon as 2023. It was delayed from 2022, but is currently in the final stages of development and was already demonstrated to the company's board of directors.

This device is also forecasted to be a niche mixed-reality (MR) headset focused on the VR aspects. At a glance, it will be much like Meta Platforms Inc.'s (NASDAQ: FB) Oculus Quest line — capable of standalone operation with battery and onboard processing. It will feature Apple silicon on par with Mac devices, a sleek design and two 8K high-resolution micro OLED displays with a resolution of up to 3,000 pixels per inch.

Reliable, dependable and predictable blue-chip stocks with solid balance sheets and profitable businesses can be excellent safe havens during market pullbacks and reward investors with significant long-term upside during economic recoveries.
The 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are among the largest blue-chip companies in the U.S. market. Here are the seven best Dow Jones stocks to buy that have the most upside in the next 12 months, according to Bank of America analysts.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)
Apple is the maker of the iPhone, but it has been shifting its priority to services revenue over device sales in recent years. Analyst Wamsi Mohan says the fiscal 2023 iPhone upgrade cycle will be stronger than average due to the need for greater connectivity to enable AV and VR applications. In addition, he says services revenue growth is boosting margins and could expand the stocks' earnings multiple over time. Apple has also been aggressively returning capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and a $200 price target for AAPL stock.

After being licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp, the tiny maddening cube was the bestselling puzzle game and toy of all time with an estimated 400 million units sold worldwide.
To qualify the top-10 bestselling products of all time, we broke them into categories of items we think are most used globally, then looked at the individual products in those categories that dominated the market.

Those losses are accompanied by two earnings reports from consumer behemoths, Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), which showed higher fuel costs, higher wages and supply chain constraints denting profits amid the highest inflation in the last four decades.
Despite consumer demand being high and companies getting away with passing off higher production costs via higher prices, the S&P 500 is sliding into bear market territory amid fears the Fed will hike interest rates at a rate that will send the U.S. into a recession.
The most recent fall Thursday in the S&P 500 puts the index on the edge of an official bear market, tumbling 18.7% from its Jan. 3 highs of 4,796. If it falls an additional 1.3% showing a 20% fall from the highs, it enters an official bear market.

Internet firms like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) were among those to reap substantial gains from the tech boom during the pandemic. Zoom’s stock surged to a record $559 in October 2020 around the time that its platform’s usage became ubiquitous for people working at home and regular users that wanted to connect with friends and families.
The confidence in Zoom and other internet stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) fueled a herd mentality that propelled the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index to an all-time high in November 2020.
But with concerns about high valuations and interest rate hikes that could lower companies’ future earnings, the Nasdaq has been on a freefall for about half a year now, retreating from its November peak of over 16,000 points to an over 18-month low of just under 12,000 points on Wednesday.

As a general rule, going to college provides more opportunities than not. At the same time, the cost of higher education is increasing and some would-be university students are essentially priced out of attending.
Researchers at Georgetown University discovered that from 1980 to 2019, the cost of college increased by 169%, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland estimated median income in the U.S. had increased 30% from 1980 to 2018.
Aware of this, some major companies are bypassing the once-required bachelor’s degree in response to the inflated costs of higher education, opening the door to thousands of potential hires.
Individuals seeking to unlock the next level of opportunity can consult this list of companies who hire without a college degree.

The AirPods Max refresh would reportedly encompass new colors. However, the analyst did not elaborate on what the new colors would be.

Wade has led to a barrage of criticism on social media, particularly from left-leaning politicians.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted that Congress “must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW.”
“If there aren’t 60 votes in the Senate to do it, and there are not, we must end the filibuster to pass it with 50 votes,” he said.

Here is a look at the most-searched-for stocks on Benzinga Pro in the month of April.
1. Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR)

YTD Return: +15.1%
52-Week Range: $31.30 to $73.34
Current Price: $49.10

Thanks to the announcement that Elon Musk was interested in acquiring social media platform Twitter, a new stock topped the Benzinga Pro ticker searches for the month of April.
Twitter took the top spot away from the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which topped searches in each of the first three months of 2022.
Musk announced he was acquiring the social media platform for $54.20 per share. Since then, Twitter shares have traded lower over concerns that the deal will be approved. Twitter will likely be a top-searched ticker during the acquisition approval process.
2. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)

YTD Return: -27.7%
52-Week Range: $546.98 to $1,243.49
Current Price: $867.63

Electric vehicle company ranked second for the fourth straight month on Benzinga Pro searches. Tesla reported first-quarter financial results in April with the announcement it had record revenue, deliveries and profits to start the year.
Tesla likely saw its ticker get increased interest in April thanks to the announcement Musk was buying Twitter.
See Also: Previous rankings for the months of January, February and March. 
3. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA: SPY)

YTD Return: -1.1%
52-Week Range: $404 to $479.98
Current Price: $407.62

The ETF that tracks the S&P 500 previously ranked as the top-searched ticker for the past three months on Benzinga Pro. ...",0.007,0.868,0.125,0.9847

However, a handful of popular stocks have severely lagged the market and generated much heavier losses for investors this year.
The threat of sharply rising interest rates and a slowdown in growth for many of the top-performing pandemic stocks has driven investors to seek shelter and safety in value stocks and defensive investments. At this point, shareholders of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks of 2022 are asking themselves whether to buy the dip or cut their losses.
Here's a look at what analysts are saying about the six worst-performing stocks of the S&P 500 in 2022.
Sell: Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX)
When it comes to 2022 underperformers, it doesn't get much worse than Netflix. The streaming video leader's stock is down 68% so far this year, making it the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500. Unfortunately for Netflix investors, Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler says things may get worse for Netflix before they get better. Schindler says Netflix's plans to reignite its growth story won't have a noticeable impact until 2024, giving investors little reason to be excited about the stock in the interim.
Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $300 price target for NFLX stock.

The sore spot was the warning regarding a $4 billion to $8 billion hit from supply disruptions in the third quarter.
The Apple Analysts: 

KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel maintained an Overweight rating and a $191 price target for Apple shares.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating and a $200 price target.
Citigroup analyst Jim Suva reiterated a Buy rating and a $200 price target.
Credit Suisse analyst Sami Badri maintained a Neutral rating and nudged up the price target from $168 to $169.
Wells Fargo Securities analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating and a $205 price target.
Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett maintained a Neutral rating and a $184 price target.
Raymond James analyst Chris Caso reiterated an Outperform rating and a $190 price target.
Needham analyst Laura Martin maintained a Buy rating and a $170 price target.

The Apple Theses: 
KeyBanc Recommend Buying Apple Shares:  Apple weathered the supply constraints and reported a record active installed device user base that testified to the company's durable business model, Nispel said.

This special, along with the Halloween and Christmas productions featuring Charles M. Schulz’s beloved Peanuts characters, have become staples of pop culture. They also inspired a genre of parody productions that frequently reconfigure Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy and the others in ways that Schultz would never have imagined, let alone condoned.
For those with a warped sense of humor and no squeamishness over occasional deep-dives into NSFW entertainment, here are the 10 weirdest Charlie Brown parodies that you’ll be able to find online.
“Bring Me the Head of Charlie Brown.” One of the earliest works by Jim Reardon of “The Simpsons” fame was this 1986 cartoon made during his studies at the California Institute of Arts. Reardon spoofs Sam Peckinpah’s “Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia” in a comically violent tale that shows Charlie Brown being ruthlessly hunted by his many antagonists before he gets his revenge in a massive shootout.

“A Charlie Brown Christmas Reunion.” This 2012 riff by Animation Domination High Def fast-forwards the Peanuts gang into their adult years, with some significant WTF developments including Linus becoming a suicidal recluse, Schroder playing piano in a gay leather bar and Pig-Pen as a homeless man sleeping in his car.

The top- and bottom-line outperformance was driven by record Services revenue and strength across all products, except for the iPad. The installed base of active devices rose to a record, signaling strong momentum going forward.
Apple's Key Q2 Metrics:  Apple reported fiscal year second-quarter earnings of $1.52 per share, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.43. This compares to the year-ago EPS of $1.40 per share and the previous quarter's $2.10.
Revenue climbed 9% year-over-year from $89.6 billion to $97.3 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated revenue of $93.89 billion, according to Benzinga Pro data. The number represented a record for the March quarter.
Sequentially, the top line fell 21.5% from the first quarter's $123.9 billion, which marked an all-time record. The first quarter is the seasonally strongest period for Apple as it encompasses the key holiday selling period.
""This quarter's record results are a testament to Apple's relentless focus on innovation and our ability to create the best products and services in the world,"" said CEO Tim Cook.

The weekend, though quiet, had its fair share of interesting developments that have ramifications for the trading week.
Here's a recap of a few major headlines that hit the wire over the weekend:
1. Twitter Folding In?  Twitter, Inc.'s (NYSE: TWTR) board met with Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk on Sunday regarding a  potential takeover, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The Journal reported a deal could be reached between both parties as early as this week. Musk reportedly made his pitch to several shareholders, mainly actively-managed funds, over a series of video calls.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives sees the rumored development as a function of a lack of a competing bid and Twitter's shaky fundamentals that could manifest in the quarterly earnings report due this week.
