The post Apple declined 2.12% to close at $161 but how much further can it drop? appeared first on Invezz.---newarticle--- Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings on April 28 after the market close. One analyst has listed three important factors Apple investors should be watching in the Apple earnings report.
The Analyst: Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan reiterated his Buy rating and $215 price target for Apple.
The Thesis: Mohan said Apple's iPhone sales, buybacks and dividends will be the three key elements of this week's report.
Mohan is projecting fiscal second-quarter iPhone unit sales of 56 million, slightly below consensus analyst estimates of 57 million.
In addition, he expects Apple to authorize a new buyback program of at least $70 billion and raise its 0.5% dividend by 5%.

Revenue climbed 9% year-over-year from $89.6 billion to $97.3 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated revenue of $93.89 billion, according to Benzinga Pro data. The number represented a record for the March quarter.
Sequentially, the top line fell 21.5% from the first quarter's $123.9 billion, which marked an all-time record. The first quarter is the seasonally strongest period for Apple as it encompasses the key holiday selling period.
""This quarter's record results are a testament to Apple's relentless focus on innovation and our ability to create the best products and services in the world,"" said CEO Tim Cook.
Gross margin came in at 43.7% compared to 43.8% in the first quarter and 42.5% in the year-ago quarter.

However, a handful of popular stocks have severely lagged the market and generated much heavier losses for investors this year.
The threat of sharply rising interest rates and a slowdown in growth for many of the top-performing pandemic stocks has driven investors to seek shelter and safety in value stocks and defensive investments. At this point, shareholders of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks of 2022 are asking themselves whether to buy the dip or cut their losses.
Here's a look at what analysts are saying about the six worst-performing stocks of the S&P 500 in 2022.
Sell: Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX)
When it comes to 2022 underperformers, it doesn't get much worse than Netflix. The streaming video leader's stock is down 68% so far this year, making it the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500. Unfortunately for Netflix investors, Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler says things may get worse for Netflix before they get better. Schindler says Netflix's plans to reignite its growth story won't have a noticeable impact until 2024, giving investors little reason to be excited about the stock in the interim.
Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $300 price target for NFLX stock.

For those with a warped sense of humor and no squeamishness over occasional deep-dives into NSFW entertainment, here are the 10 weirdest Charlie Brown parodies that you’ll be able to find online.
“Bring Me the Head of Charlie Brown.” One of the earliest works by Jim Reardon of “The Simpsons” fame was this 1986 cartoon made during his studies at the California Institute of Arts.

“A Charlie Brown Christmas Reunion.” This 2012 riff by Animation Domination High Def fast-forwards the Peanuts gang into their adult years, with some significant WTF developments including Linus becoming a suicidal recluse, Schroder playing piano in a gay leather bar and Pig-Pen as a homeless man sleeping in his car.

Here is a look at the most-searched-for stocks on Benzinga Pro in the month of April.
1. Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR)

YTD Return: +15.1%
52-Week Range: $31.30 to $73.34
Current Price: $49.10

Thanks to the announcement that Elon Musk was interested in acquiring social media platform Twitter, a new stock topped the Benzinga Pro ticker searches for the month of April.
Twitter took the top spot away from the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which topped searches in each of the first three months of 2022.
Musk announced he was acquiring the social media platform for $54.20 per share. Since then, Twitter shares have traded lower over concerns that the deal will be approved. Twitter will likely be a top-searched ticker during the acquisition approval process.
2. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)

YTD Return: -27.7%
52-Week Range: $546.98 to $1,243.49
Current Price: $867.63

Electric vehicle company ranked second for the fourth straight month on Benzinga Pro searches. Tesla reported first-quarter financial results in April with the announcement it had record revenue, deliveries and profits to start the year.
Tesla likely saw its ticker get increased interest in April thanks to the announcement Musk was buying Twitter.

A ""Distraction Vortex:"" Apple's supply chain issues have been blown out of proportion and are now somewhat of an ""investor distraction vertex,"" Munster said in a note.
""The conversation of supply chain is important because it masks the pace of intrinsic growth, making it difficult to discern the health of the business.""

1. Crypto Market Swoons & Experts Debate:  As Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) hurtles toward its lowest since late January, the so-called crypto experts were in full flow dissecting the downward spiral and the likely causative factors.

What Happened:  Apple's director of machine learning, Ian Goodfellow, has departed in protest of its return-to-work policy, a tweet from Verge tech reporter Zoe Schiffer said.
Apple hired Goodfellow, a former Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) executive, in April 2019. He also had a stint at Elon Musk-founded OpenAI lab.

What Happened: Kuo said Sunday evening that Twitter’s business may be partially similar to the one run by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC: TCEHY), the company behind the super-app WeChat. 
Kuo pointed out in a Twitter thread that Tencent’s revenue from social networking — including subscriptions — advertising, and fintech and business service in 2021 was $17.6 billion, $13.3 billion, and $25.8 billion, respectively.

This interesting information was shared by former Apple executive and the creator of Nest Labs Tony Fadell,  according to TechCrunch. Fadell is often credited as the father of the iPod and a co-creator of the iPhone.
Outside Inspiration: When Apple's collaboration with Motorola to launch Rokr E1, the first phone to run iTunes, did not yield the desired results, Cupertino began to seriously brainstorm on an indigenously-designed smartphone.
The company wanted to take home all the learnings and design from its hugely-successfully iPod and replicate its success, Fadell reportedly said. At that time, a third-party manufacturer sent the company a prototype, calling it an iPod-Phone, he added.

As a general rule, going to college provides more opportunities than not. At the same time, the cost of higher education is increasing and some would-be university students are essentially priced out of attending.
Researchers at Georgetown University discovered that from 1980 to 2019, the cost of college increased by 169%, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland estimated median income in the U.S. had increased 30% from 1980 to 2018.
Aware of this, some major companies are bypassing the once-required bachelor’s degree in response to the inflated costs of higher education, opening the door to thousands of potential hires.
Individuals seeking to unlock the next level of opportunity can consult this list of companies who hire without a college degree.

According to 9 analyst offering 12-month price targets in the last 3 months, Apple has an average price target of $186.78 with a high of $200.00 and a low of $168.00. 
Below is a summary of how these 9 analysts rated Apple over the past 3 months. The greater the number of bullish ...Full story available on Benzinga.com---newarticle--- One of the major indices, the S&P 500, is down more than 2% for the week. Those losses are accompanied by two earnings reports from consumer behemoths, Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), which showed higher fuel costs, higher wages and supply chain constraints denting profits amid the highest inflation in the last four decades.
Despite consumer demand being high and companies getting away with passing off higher production costs via higher prices, the S&P 500 is sliding into bear market territory amid fears the Fed will hike interest rates at a rate that will send the U.S. into a recession.
The most recent fall Thursday in the S&P 500 puts the index on the edge of an official bear market, tumbling 18.7% from its Jan. 3 highs of 4,796. If it falls an additional 1.3% showing a 20% fall from the highs, it enters an official bear market.
What about FAANG stocks? The stocks that are accountable for 13.02% of the total weight of the S&P 500, or 14.9% if Alphabet Inc's Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG) shares are included.

Internet firms like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) were among those to reap substantial gains from the tech boom during the pandemic. Zoom’s stock surged to a record $559 in October 2020 around the time that its platform’s usage became ubiquitous for people working at home and regular users that wanted to connect with friends and families.
The confidence in Zoom and other internet stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) fueled a herd mentality that propelled the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index to an all-time high in November 2020.
But with concerns about high valuations and interest rate hikes that could lower companies’ future earnings, the Nasdaq has been on a freefall for about half a year now, retreating from its November peak of over 16,000 points to an over 18-month low of just under 12,000 points on Wednesday.

Facebook's Slow Start And Pick-up:  Facebook had a turbulent debut session, marred by technical glitches and the stock moved mostly sideways for another year or so.
From the middle of 2013, Facebook's stock began a steady climb until mid-2018, when the company was rocked by multiple scandals involving data privacy, Russian interference and fake news.
Facebook emerged out of all these challenges and the stock began tracking an upward trajectory in late-2018. The broader uptrend continued until early 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak hit stocks across sectors.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)

Analyst Wamsi Mohan says the fiscal 2023 iPhone upgrade cycle will be stronger than average due to the need for greater connectivity to enable AV and VR applications. In addition, he says services revenue growth is boosting margins and could expand the stocks' earnings multiple over time. Apple has also been aggressively returning capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.

What Happened: According to Stereoscopic Displays and VR Systems III Preface, Apple demonstrated a wearable computer prototype with a head-mounted display as far back as 1996. And in an Apple Research report titled ""Volumetric Hyper Reality, A Computer Graphics Holy Grail for the 21st Century?,"" it's evident that the company has explored hyper-reality and environmental feedback displays as far back as 1995.

Today, Apple boasts a massive augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) research unit with hundreds of employees. The company has also acquired tons of companies over the years in an effort to become a major player in the AR/VR space. 
As a result, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant is now on the verge of debuting at least two separate product lines that could shake up this segment. The first device will be a VR visor with AR features expected to launch as soon as 2023. It was delayed from 2022, but is currently in the final stages of development and was already demonstrated to the company's board of directors.

On June 14, multiple business news outlets carried variations of the headline “Disney Loses Streaming Rights for Indian Premier League Cricket.” The coverage within these outlets detailed how a consortium that included Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARAA)(NASDAQ: PARA) outbid current rights owner, the Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS), by paying $2.6 billion for the Indian subcontinent streaming rights to the IPL cricket tournament for 2023 through 2027, with many observers insisting this was a misstep for Disney.
These same observers declined to fixate on the fact Disney secured the television rights to broadcast the matches in the Indian subcontinent from 2023 to 2027 for $3 billion, and most of them failed to emphasize that Disney was not aggressively focused on retaining the streaming rights.
In many ways, this epitomizes the problem in trying to determine how Disney competes against its rivals. The company has a history of inventing new playing fields and quickly dominating fields created by others.
But will the current environment demand a bold new game plan for a company that is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year?
From Game-Changer To Game-Usurper: Disney holds the distinction of being the only studio from Hollywood’s Golden Age that was never gobbled up by conglomerates or investors — although it did fend off an unwelcome hostile takeover bid in 1984.
In the years when Walt Disney was in charge, the company created new environments by bringing sounding to cartoons and then stretching the animated shorts into feature-length films. Disney established the nature documentary as a genre within non-fiction filmmaking and embraced television in the 1950s when other studios viewed the medium as a menace.
Disney was not the first film producer to explore product merchandising, but he went forth with an audacity and success rate that was without precedent. The company’s expansion into theme parks and the travel and hospitality sector was also groundbreaking for an entertainment company.
In the years that followed Walt Disney’s passing in 1967, the company would never be the bold entity to create new opportunities. For example, Disney was not the first studio to explore the potential of videocassettes in the home entertainment market — 20th Century Fox began licensing their films to the Magnetic Video label in 1977, with Disney following suit later in the decade by licensing some of their titles to DiscoVision for the ill-fated LaserDisc format.
Disney was also later than other companies in arriving on the Internet (Disney.com turned up in 1996), in the cable television market (Disney Channel went on the air in 1983), in the app world (DisneyNow debuted in 2017) and in the streaming sector (Disney+ premiered in 2019).
While it quickly played catch-up to take prominence in those spaces, sometimes its tardiness came with a price: in its second-quarter 2022 earnings report, the company acknowledged that it paid more than $1 billion to “a customer to early terminate license agreements for film and television content delivered in previous years.” In translation, it meant it had to fork over a lot of money to regain properties it licensed before getting around to start Disney+.

Still In The Race: Disney’s prominence in the current entertainment industry has its foundation in four key acquisitions during Bob Iger’s term as chief executive: the purchases of Pixar in 2006, Marvel Entertainment in 2009, Lucasfilm in 2012 and 21st Century Fox in 2019. With these acquisitions, the company bulked up its portfolio with a surplus of audience-favorite material that was effectively dispatched to the company’s various platforms and sectors.

During the Walt Disney Co.’s (NYSE: DIS) fiscal year, first quarter earnings call, CEO Bob Chapek was asked a question by Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) analyst Jason Bazinet on whether he viewed the metaverse as a strategic endeavor that is “going to become potentially a more important piece of your core competency going forward.”
Chapek responded to Bazinet’s inquiry by declaring, “This is a very top of mind thing for us because we are continuing over time to augment our skills and the types of people that we attract into the Walt Disney Co. to reflect the aggressive and ambitious technology agenda that we have. You probably notice that one of my three pillars is innovation and specifically technological innovation because we realize that this is going to be an important part of telling a story in that third dimension, that lean forward interactive dimension. So, it is absolutely top of mind.”
But in the fiscal year, second-quarter earnings call featuring Chapek that was conducted on May 11, no question was raised concerning the metaverse and no information was volunteered by Chapek on what progress was made by Disney in this area since the earlier call.
And the word metaverse was nowhere to be found in the company’s fiscal year, second-quarter earnings report — nor, for that matter, were the words non-fungible tokens or NFTs.
This absence is curious, given Chapek’s advocacy of “technological innovation” in his fiscal year, first-quarter earnings call and his enthusiasm for the subject in a Fortune interview from January. But that’s not to say Disney has retreated from the digital environments of NFTs and the metaverse — it’s just that the company’s forward movement is occurring at a somewhat leisurely pace.

In Search Of Disney: Rebekah Barton, senior entertainment editor for the Inside the Magic blog that focuses on all things Disney, recalled being intrigued on the February earnings call, although she wondered why there was no depth to Chapek’s pronouncement.
“It was sort of intriguing because it was like they were trying to stay ahead of the curve,” she recalled. “But there wasn't a lot of concrete detail given. Whether that's because they simply weren't ready to share or because it's actually not ready, I can't know.”
Chapek’s lack of detail was on display earlier in a January interview with Fortune where he spoke enthusiastically — if vaguely — about the subject.
“The precursor to everything we’re talking about with the metaverse and this customer-personalized blending of physical and digital is the database,” said Chapek, who viewed data mining as his key to success.
“We’ve been collecting very deep, rich data for a long time from our parks. When you sign on to Disney+, we know who you are. We’ve got volumes of hard data that tell us exactly what were the first streams, when did the first streams come on, how long did people watch, how many times did they watch?

The effect is that he is 2% higher than consensus on revenues and 3.5% higher on EPS.

The split brought shares of Alphabet’s Class C stock (GOOG) down from Friday’s closing price of $2,255.34 to a split-adjusted price of $113.44.
The stock split means that every shareholder received 19 additional shares for each share of Alphabet they owned. The split made shares of the tech giant more attractive to retail investors and for options traders, and the price of both calls and puts has also become more affordable.
Alphabet didn’t run up higher into the event, although the stock reversed course into an uptrend on June 17, which may have surprised investors who watched Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) surge prior to their stock splits in 2020.

That’s not necessarily the right thing to do, explains Herb founder and CEO Matt Gray whose mission is to pay it forward and inspire 10 million entrepreneurs to live their dreams.
Amidst a slowing economy, Gray urged entrepreneurs to recognize their venture is a marathon and, in order to speed up, they should consider “slowing down and taking better care of themselves and those around them.”
Why’s that? Read on for Gray’s journey in building and selling businesses, perspectives and tips for success.
Find A Problem And Solve It: The Sharon, Ontario native’s foray into entrepreneurship started at 20 years old.
While managing 28 retail locations for Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC), on the side with three friends, Gray built Bitmaker Labs, a school for technologists.
“It was a place for software engineers to train for jobs at technology companies like Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), and IBM (NYSE: IBM).”
After training nearly 3,000 technologists, and selling it to General Assembly, Gray pivoted.
This time, the problem was that there “existed no platform for consumers and brands to connect over curated and trustworthy content,” he explained on getting the word out about the treatment that saved his friends' lives from feelings of suicide and depression.
“There wasn’t an experience akin to the kind you’d expect outside of weed.”
The Google Of Weed: Over the course of nearly a decade, Gray and a small team of up to 50 grew Herb to a community of 41 million loyal fans, all raving for what is 31,000 published pieces of cannabis-focused content.
Gray practices what he preaches. For those years Herb has operated, it has only published, consistently, 12 pieces of content a day on culture, education, “and everything in between.”

He believed QCOM would report 3Q22 results roughly in line with consensus/guidance, with lower-than-expected units offset by continued pricing strength.

Apple’s Key Q3 Numbers:  Apple’s third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.20, down from $1.30 per share a year ago. Sequentially, the bottom line fell about 21% from the June quarter’s $1.52.
Revenue rose 2% year-over-year but fell about 14.7% quarter-over-quarter to $83 billion. The year-over-year growth tapered off to the slowest pace of growth since 2020 but marked a record revenue performance for the June quarter.
Analysts, on average, estimated EPS of $1.16 on revenue of $82.6 billion.
Third-quarter gross margin was at 43.3%, flat with the year-ago period. The metric, however, contracted from the previous quarter’s 43.7%.

Barnum imported the Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind and arranged for her name and likeness to be associated with a wide range of products including clothing, furniture and pianos.
Into the 20th century, the increased power of print and broadcast media and a greater public fixation on celebrities let more companies recruit performers and athletes as spokespersons for their brands.
Sometimes, very popular celebrities spokespersons overstay their welcome or get tripped up by extraordinary circumstances. General Electric (NYSE: GE) dropped Ronald Reagan as its spokesperson when his personal appearances on behalf of the company veered away from product hype to political messaging; a similar situation derailed Anita Bryant's long run as the celebrity spokesperson for Florida's orange juice industry. O.J. Simpson and Bill Cosby were popular favorites for their respective long-running advertisements for Hertz Global Holdings' (OTC: HTZGQ) rental car service and Kraft Heinz Company's (NASDAQ: KHC) Jell-O puddings, respectively, but today they are not quite beloved by the public.
But on occasion, companies pick the wrong celebrities to promote their brands. Here is a quintet of stars whose salesmanship efforts went hopelessly awry, with astonishing results.
Madonna for Pepsi. In March 1989, Madonna was the hottest star in the music industry when PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) signed her to appear in a television commercial. The spot, dubbed “Make a Wish,” served the dual purpose of promoting Pepsi while offering a preview of the singer’s upcoming hit song, “Like a Prayer.”

The two-minute commercial aired during an episode of “The Cosby Show” and was a relatively benign affair, intercutting scenes from the “Like a Prayer” music video with quick shots of the Pepsi product and logo. However, Madonna coyly told Rolling Stone that “the treatment for the video is a lot more controversial. It’s probably going to touch a lot of nerves in a lot of people.”
And how! The “Like a Prayer” music video was released the day after the commercial aired, complete with raw and visceral blending of sexual and religious imagery that created seismic outrage stretching from the Bible Belt — the right-wing American Family Association called for a PepsiCo boycott — to the Vatican — Pope John Paul II demanded the music video be banned from Italian television.
While PepsiCo had nothing to do with the music video, the company quickly ...---newarticle--- Global smartphone shipments fell to the lowest level in two years in the second quarter of 2022, data from research firm Canalys showed.

South Korean electronics giant Samsung shipped 61.8 million smartphones in the quarter, giving it a 21% share of the overall market. Quarter-over-quarter, its market share fell 3 percentage points.
Samsung’s aggressive pricing with its low-end A series and cost-effective ODM production, and its focus on foldable phones and S series in the premium segment drive sales, Canalys said.

With the indexes reaching 52-week lows and several issues in the tech sector revisiting pandemic lows or beyond — and rising interest rates as the result of rampant inflation — much of Wall Street was prepared for lower prices.
All of this, along with the war in Ukraine, had investors on edge ahead of the second-quarter earnings season
Gene Munster, the managing partner of Loup Ventures, was one of the investors attempting to maneuver a vastly different environment from the last several years.
As it turns out, much of the technology sector and mega-cap tech for the most part satisfied the Street's expectations in the second quarter, and the market has responded. Many companies that missed expectations were not treated as harshly.

Earnings Highlights: Qualcomm remains focused on diversifying its revenue streams. The chipmaker aims to transform itself from a ""phone chip company"" to a ""connected processor company,"" Palkhiwala said.

Woz’s Cream Soda Inspiration
In 1971, Wozniak, who is known as “The Woz” in tech circles, built what was called the “Cream Soda” computer. 
The computer earned its name because Wozniak and his friend Bill Fernandez, who went on to become one of the first employees at Apple, were drinking Cragmont Cream Soda while creating it, according to Emberify founder Shashwat Pradhan, who interviewed Wozniak.
In the now archived 2014 interview, Wozniak said the computer was built before useful microprocessors were created. 
The computer was not a machine that we are familiar with today, according to Pradhan. It had no screen or keyboard; instead, input was achieved via punched cards and output was received in the form of a sequence of lights.

Buffett has been one of the greatest investors of the last six decades and remains the active chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B). This article will showcase a highlight from each decade of Buffett’s personal and investment career.
1930: Warren Buffett was born Aug. 30, 1930. His father Howard was a former stockbroker, which would have a huge influence on Buffett’s decision to get involved with the business.
1940: Buffett purchased his first stock at the age of 11. The purchase was for three shares of Cities Service Preferred, a natural gas company. Buffett bought the shares at $38 only to see them soon drop to $27 each. He waited until they hit $40 to sell for a profit. Shares later hit $200 each, which Buffett has since cited as a lesson on patience in investing.

Terms of that deal have helped Prescott be one of the highest-paid NFL players. Add in several key endorsement deals, including one that’s new in 2022, and Prescott may make more off the field than he does taking snaps for the Cowboys this 2022 season.

For the 2022 season, Prescott will get paid a base salary of $1.6 million. The low figure comes as the quarterback restructured his deal to help the Cowboys with salary cap relief. With the base salary, a signing bonus of $13.2 million (broken down by year) and $4.93 million in restructured salary, Prescott is set to make around $20 million in 2022, according to Spotrac.

Fire & Ice: Part Deux
Recall earlier this month when the S&P 500 index extended its losses to three straight weeks? Wilson, a Morgan Stanley equity strategist, blamed the Federal Reserve.
“With the Fed emphatically dashing hopes for a dovish pivot, we think that asset markets may be entering 'fire and ice part deux,'"" he said.
In contrast to part one, the decline in stocks would come mostly via a higher equity risk premium and lower earnings, Wilson added. He also correctly predicted that the decline in S&P 500 earnings was far from over.
“In short, part deux will be more icy than fiery,"" he said. ""The opposite of 1H22.”

Historically, they perform best when interest rates are falling and company earnings are on the rise. However, they become vulnerable when the economy begins to decline and the cheap money that can fuels fast growth becomes more difficult to find. 
But despite the current state of economies, many growth companies managed to prosper and made it through various economic hurdles that the past two years presented.

""Fast forward two years. The world has changed dramatically,"" Gerstner said Thursday on CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report.""

The disappointing unveiling led to Apple's stock retreating during market hours by close to 1%. Meanwhile, Apple is down close to 4% during Tuesday's trading hours, as a hotter than expected inflation weighed on the markets.
The iPhone 14 has been priced at $799, meanwhile, the iPhone 13 has been discounted to $699. Apple killed the iPhone mini, and instead now has two main models a 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and 6.7 inches iPhone 14 plus. Apple has introduced a number of new features for the latest phone including the addition of satellite connection capabilities, the addition of eSim capabilities, 8k video capture, and the new A16 chips. Apple's fans won't be overly impressed, but considering the stickiness of the product, expect the phone to continue dominating sales.

What Happened: Apple is now the most shorted stock in the public markets by dollars, according to a report from S3 Partners.
Apple has $18.44 billion in shares short. The total now passes the previous record holder, electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA). According to the report, Tesla has $17.44 billion in shares short.
“Tesla has held the top spot in the short interest league tables for 864 days, almost two and a half years since April 2020, but Apple has recently recaptured the crown,” S3 Partners Managing Director Ihor Dusaniwsky said.

What Happened: Viewership for the first week of NFL games was up compared to the first week of 2021, which could be a good sign for the companies spending billions of dollars on streaming rights.
NFL games in the first week averaged 18.5 million viewers, up 3% from last season’s first week. This marked the best start to an NFL season since 2016, according to Front Office Sports.
More than 121 million people watched NFL games in the first week, a figure that was up 5% from the previous year. On Sunday, around 83 million people watched NFL games.
“As the viewership numbers would indicate, our fans are obviously excited to have the NFL back,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.
NBC, owned by Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA), aired the first week’s Sunday Night Football contest with a matchup between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Dallas Cowboys. The game had more than 21 million viewers according to the company, marking the best Sunday Night Football opener since 2015.

Credit card debt came down from an all-time high of $930 billion in late 2019, according to New York Fed data, but the average credit card holder in the U.S. still had $5,769 in credit card debt by the first quarter of 2022, with balances only slightly below pre-pandemic levels, according to MoneyGeek.

Those games, like many before them, could see strong viewership due to a home run chase happening with the team's star player.
What Happened: Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge has hit 60 home runs on the season as of Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2022. The slugger has the lead for home runs in the American League and across all of Major League Baseball.
The next home run hit by Judge, if he hits another, would tie him with Roger Maris for the single-season American League record. Hitting 62 home runs would be the American League record and could also be considered the Major League record by some, as the records set by Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds come into question due to their links to steroid use.
Trying to make history, the home run chase from Judge has led to increased viewership of Yankees games, which could benefit several media partners along with the team's own broadcasting platform.

The major U.S. averages closed Thursday’s session on a mixed note, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indices declining sharply, while the Dow Industrials bucked the downtrend. While earnings reports from a couple of Dow components propped up the blue-chip average, earnings also proved to be the undoing of the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.
Traders also reacted to advance third-quarter GDP report, which showed quicker-than-expected growth.
“The U.S. is not currently in recession, given the strength of the consumer sector,” Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial said. Excluding more volatile categories, the growth trajectory looks weak, he added.
“A deteriorating housing market and nagging inflation along with an aggressive Federal Reserve put the economy on unsure footing for 2023,” the economist said, adding that the markets have possibly priced in much of the near-term recession risks.

TikTok recently announced the expansion of its universe with the inclusion of an exclusive section for video games.
The app that revolutionized the mobile video market now aims to repeat its success in the field of mobile games, albeit without neglecting its main offering.
ByteDance, the company that owns the platform, has not yet confirmed when the video game catalog will be available on the social network. As reported by the Financial Times, the official announcement should arrive in the next week.
According to the British media outlet, these games would be integrated into the existing TikTok app, so users would not have to download an additional component to access this functionality. Instead, a new exclusive tab would be added to the app.

Robinhood had a solid third quarter, and the company said on its earnings call that its customer base of retail traders also outperformed in the third quarter as well.
Robinhood investors are hoping the stock has finally stopped the bleeding after losing more than two-thirds of its value in the last 12 months. Robinhood's business boomed in 2021 during a period of market mania for meme stocks and cryptocurrencies.
Yet investors have dumped risk assets in 2022 as the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates.
As a result, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) prices are down 57.1% and 58.7% year-to-date, respectively. Popular meme stocks GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) are also down 31.3% and 79.9%, respectively.

Stocks closed the week ended Nov. 5 on a downbeat note, with technology stocks serving as drags on the overall market. The weekly losses reflected trader reaction to the Federal Reserve’s 75 basis point rate hike as well as hawkish commentary by Chair Jerome Powell at the press conference, mixed earnings news flow and the strong October jobs data. Nevertheless, stocks ended the week on a firmer footing.

Specifically, Loup Funds Managing Partner Gene Munster  said a new CEO announcement could be two to three years away.
The venture capitalist on Thursday put forward a list of potential replacements for Musk, taking into account both internal and external candidates. The list has been arranged in the order of probability, he added.
1. Herbert Deiss:  The former CEO of German automaker Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY), Deiss is the most probable successor from the list of seven candidates, Munster said. Two things working in his favor are his quest toward rapid electrification even while he was at the German automaker, and the respect he commands from Musk.
2. J.B. Straubel:  Straubel, the CEO and founder of Redwood Materials and co-founder of Tesla, is strong when it comes to batteries — an important component of electric vehicles — Munster said.

Here's the latest:

Since Elon Musk took the helm at Twitter, about half the company’s workforce was laid off.
Twitter founder Jack Dorsey took part of the blame for overgrowing the company at times of financial tailwinds.
Meta (NASDAQ: META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a similar sentiment in a letter where he announced the firing of 11,000 employees — 13% of the company’s global staff.
Earlier this month, Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) decided to remove 13% of employees from its payroll.
Digital payments giant Stripe cut 14% of its workforce.
In August, ​​1,300 of a total of 6,400 Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) employees were shown the door.
In July, Shopify shut down 10% of its workforce.
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is expected to let go over 10,000 employees (it froze new hires at least until 2023)
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is also reportedly on a hiring freeze.

These are just a few examples of a trend that is reaching far more than the best-known names in tech. Layoffs.fiy, a site that has been tracking layoffs in the tech industry since the start of the pandemic, has registered 136,989 layoffs from 849 companies in 2022 alone.

What Happened: Against this backdrop, a prominent Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) analyst said a reversal is contingent on the materialization of three events — a Fed pause, resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war and China ending its lockdowns.
Three factors could set off a bull market rally, said Ross Berger, co-founder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management.
If these materialize, investors can brace for a much higher stock market in 2023, he added.

Tesla bulls Gary Black  of Future Fund and Ross Gerber  of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth And Investment Management did not take kindly to Musk’s comments.
Gerber reminded Musk about his “tiff” with Apple in the past. The Tesla CEO had previously criticized the 30% app store fee Apple levies, calling it a “tax on internet.” Musk himself confessed in 2020 that he had sought an appointment with Apple CEO Tim Cook  in 2018 when Tesla was on the brink to discuss a potential sale to the tech giant, but Cook promptly turned down the request.
Gerber also took a dig at Apple for pulling back ads amid a challenging environment.

Good News For Apple:  The easing of restrictions in China is good news for Apple, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said. The factory has been operating at 20-30% of its capacity over the past month, resulting in a massive iPhone shortage globally, he noted.
The analyst estimates that demand versus supply now stands at a ratio of 3:1 and about roughly 10-15 million iPhones will move from the December quarter to the March quarter.

Overall, 2022 was a very tough year for the stock market. As of this writing, the S&P 500 has returned -17%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is -7% and the Nasdaq leads the year in losses with a return of nearly -30%. Once-reliable mega-cap technology darlings like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have seen a stunning fall from grace in 2022. Apple is down 21% YTD, Amazon has dropped nearly 45% and Google has declined over 34% through the first eleven months of 2022.
However, not all stocks have fallen prey to the market’s “doom and gloom” mentality. Asure Software (NASDAQ: ASUR) is one stock that has rebounded after a tough start to 2022 and is now posting a positive gain for 2022, as of this writing. Given the company's strong recent third-quarter 2022 financial results and its continuation of impressive growth, Asure is bucking the overall market and outperforming major indices, as the company’s business model thrives in the current economic environment. 
Asure Software Thriving Amid Current Economic Environment
Asure’s suite of SaaS solutions helps provide comprehensive back-office support for small and medium businesses (SMBs). These services help to streamline important operations such as HR, payroll, employment benefits, taxes, and more, which helps SMBs to cut costs and save money. Not to mention, Asure’s services can help SMBs be more effective in competing for top employee talent, as it allows SMBs to offer enticing employment benefits typically offered by larger businesses.
Furthermore, Asure has continued to build relationships with other firms to help bolster its services. Equifax (NYSE: EFX) and its Work Number services help clients quickly verify income and employment history. Asure has also linked up with PrismHR to boost its payroll tax management services and its FlexTax platform. This allows Asure to market its FlexTax platform to PrismHR’s 80,000 registered client base.

In recent months, Asure has worked closely with its CPA partners to help develop new technologies to help streamline the demand for Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) filings.

This week, S3 Partners released an updated report on the most profitable stocks of the year for short sellers, and Tesla leads the way by leaps and bounds.
S3 estimates Tesla short sellers had generated $15 billion in profits in 2022 through Dec. 21, which does not include Tesla's nearly 9% decline on Thursday.
Tesla's stock price is down 69.5% year-to-date in 2022, and the selling pressure has intensified in the last two months as investors fear financial fallout from Tesla CEO Elon Musk's chaotic $44-billion takeover of Twitter and a potential slowdown in EV demand.

Here’s what investors, fans of Musk and movie lovers should know.
What Happened: The Netflix movie “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” featured a character that might resemble Musk and be related to his acquisition of social media platform Twitter.
The character Miles Bron is a technology billionaire who has interests in space exploration and automotives, two sectors Musk had disrupted in real life. Played by Edward Norton in the movie, Bron was portrayed as someone who stole ideas and took credit for items he wasn’t behind.
Movie director Rian Johnson recently shared with Wired that Musk might have been an inspiration for the character.
Johnson told Wired he wrote the screenplay during COVID-19 lockdowns, prior to Musk announcing plans to purchase Twitter. The movie director joked he didn’t know about this ahead of time, but viewers could see parallels between the behavior of the tech billionaires both fictional and in real life.

Not to mention the much-loved Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock, which was down 71% this year, with nearly 38% of those losses coming in just the last month.

Here's Benzinga’s list of best-performing stocks screened based on a few criteria:
1. Target Hospitality Corp. (NASDAQ: TH)
YTD Gains:  +310%
Target Hospitality, founded in 1978, provides cost-effective and customized specialty rental accommodations, culinary services and hospitality solutions for end markets, including oil, gas, energy infrastructure and the government. The Woodland, Texas-based company’s third-quarter results revealed 79% revenue growth and 125% adjusted EBITDA growth. The stock got a solid lift in July following the release of its second-quarter results, in which it upwardly revised its revenue guidance.
After a consolidation move, the stock legged up again, reacting to the third-quarter results.
The average analysts’ price target, compiled by TipRanks, is $20.67, suggesting roughly 42% upside potential on top of the stellar run for the year.
2. Amplify Energy Corp. (NYSE: AMPY)
YTD Gains:  +188%
Houston, Texas-based Amplify Energy is an independent oil and natural gas company. The stock’s rally that began at the start of 2022 continued unhindered through the middle of the year, coinciding with oil’s rally. Subsequently, the stock was locked in a broad sideways move, as oil’s rally lost steam.
Given crude oil prices could stay high amid supply constraints and forecasts for higher demand, the stock could be in for further upside from current levels.
3. Prometheus Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ: RXDX)
YTD Gains:  +175%
Prometheus is a clinical-stage biotech based out of San Diego, California, and it focuses on developing therapeutics and companion diagnostic products for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. The company went public in early 2021 and its shares were listed on the Nasdaq in March 2021.

In 2022, 131 members of Congress filed stock and options trading disclosures. This figure was down from 147 members in 2021. The report tracked $788 million in trades from more than 12,700 transactions. The number of transactions was similar to 2021, with around $189 million less traded in 2022 than the previous year.
The report found House Republicans had more than 1,000 fewer trades in 2022. House Democrats had over 1,000 more trades in 2022 compared to the previous year.
Democrats saw an average return of -1.76% and Republicans saw an average return of 0.4%, both beating the -18% return of the S&P 500 in 2022.
Over the past 10 years, about 10% of fund managers outperformed the S&P 500, according to SPIVA data, while in 2022, about 5% of total Congress outperformed.
When just comparing the Congressional members who traded — just 131 of the possible 535 — 26 beat the market. That equates to 20%, a much higher rate than professional money managers over time.
Here were the top 10 members of Congress by 2022 return, according to the report:

This represents additional context to the 2026 (pre-split) price target of $4,600 the firm announced in mid-April 2022. 
Keeney noted that the firm is removing autonomous driving and any form of ride-hail from the valuation framework. The firm believes that these two factors will drive more than 60% of Tesla’s value over the next five years.

For the fourth time in four years, the jackpot on the Mega Millions lottery drawing has topped the $1 billion mark.
Here’s a look at the historic jackpot and what you could buy with the after-tax lump sum winnings.
What Happened: The Mega Millions drawing on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2023, is currently listed at $1.1 billion, which is the third-largest jackpot in the game’s history.
The $1.1 billion jackpot trails only the $1.537 billion won in 2018 and the $1.337 billion won in July 2022.
Tickets cost $2 to play with an additional $1 option cost for a multiplier that raises the nonjackpot winning payouts.
Five white balls are drawn numbered 1 to 70 and a gold Mega Ball numbered 1 to 25 is drawn. A person has to match all six to win the overall jackpot.
Players can select their own numbers for their tickets, with lucky numbers, birthdays and anniversaries often among the favorite selections. Players can also receive random numbers by selecting an easy pick/quick pick.
The overall odds to win the jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350. The odds to win a prize of at least $4 are 1 in 24.
If no one matched all six balls Tuesday night, the jackpot will increase ahead of a drawing on Friday, Jan. 13, 2022.
How Much Do You Win?: The jackpot for Tuesday’s drawing stands at $1.1 billion with a listed cash payment of $568.7 million.
The jackpot is paid out over a 30-year period with an initial payment upon winning and an annual payment for the next 29 years. Each annual payment goes up by 5% to attempt to offset inflation.
Given the current high inflation era that we are in, a person who wins the jackpot is immediately tasked with choosing whether they want all the money upfront or to be paid annually and if they think the 5% is enough to offset ...---newarticle--- Broadcom shares fell on reports that Apple was working on its own RF chips, but one analyst wondered if it was all a negotiating ploy.---newarticle--- Wall Street analysts make new stock picks on a daily basis.

Brady previously announced his retirement from the league in February 2022 before deciding one month later that he would return.
Brady said in his retirement video on social media on Wednesday that this time he is stepping away from playing ""for good."" 
Brady was the oldest player in the NFL for the 2022-2023 season. Drafted 199th overall in the 2000 NFL Draft on April 6, 2000, a lot has changed since Brady first entered the league.
Here’s a look at 23 things that weren’t around when Brady joined the NFL.
Cryptocurrency: Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was founded in 2009, following a white paper released the previous year. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is more than $400 billion and one of many cryptocurrencies that are now readily available to trade by consumers, including on the FTX app endorsed by Brady.
Twitter: Social media platform Twitter Inc was founded in March 2006. Brady has 2.8 million followers on the social media platform as of today.
Facebook: Social media platform Facebook, which is owned by Meta Platforms inc (NASDAQ: META), was founded in 2004, two years after Brady joined the NFL.
Instagram: Photo and video sharing social media platform Instagram, which is owned by Meta Platforms, launched in 2010. Brady has more than 13 million followers on Instagram, but trails his ex-wife, model Gisele Bundchen at 20.5 million.
iPhone: Now one of the most popular smartphones in the world, the iPhone wasn’t launched until 2007 by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Brady couldn’t own an iPhone until his eighth season in the NFL.
Netflix Streaming: Now used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, the ability to stream movies and television shows from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) wasn’t a reality when Brady joined the league. Netflix launched in 1998 as a DVD by mail service and would later add streaming in 2007.
Amazon Prime: E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) launched in the ...---newarticle--- Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is releasing its fourth-quarter financial report after the close Thursday. Here’s what investors need to know ahead of the print. 
The consensus estimate for Amazon’s fourth-quarter revenue is $145 billion, in line with the e-commerce giant’s recent guidance. Amazon said during its third-quarter call in October that it expected fourth-quarter revenue to be between $140 billion and $148 billion, equating to year-over-year growth of between 2% to 8%.
The company made headlines on Tuesday for illegally resisting unionization efforts by its employees, as per a National Labor Relations Board judge.
Markets have been responding positively in anticipation of the call, with the company's stock gaining almost 20% in the last month and 4.6% in the last five days.
Hard Times Ahead For Big Tech?
On Monday, Barclays analyst Ross Sandler cut the price target for Amazon from $140 to $130 and maintained an Overweight rating.

Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock?---newarticle--- Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that missed expectations. iPhone revenue trailed forecasts, while strength in Services and iPad helped offset some of the weakness.
How Apple Did On Key Q1 Metrics:  Cupertino, California-based Apple reported first-quarter earnings per share of $1.88, missing the consensus estimate of $1.94 per share and declining from the year-ago EPS of $2.01.
Apple’s top line fell 5% year-over-year to $117.2 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $121.1 billion.
The December quarter, which is Apple’s fiscal first quarter, is also its busiest and seasonally strong quarter. Expectations were muted this time around.
On the fourth-quarter earnings call held in late October, CFO Luca Maestri  said the year-over-year growth in revenue would slow down in the December quarter.

The Apple Thesis: Apple’s first-quarter iPhone revenue miss reflects roughly eight million to nine million units being pushed out of the December quarter due to supply chain issues and an 800 basis points of forex headwinds, Ives said.
“We believe overall given the supply chain disaster that Apple saw this was better than feared iPhone number and ultimately more of a supply issue than a demand issue,” the analyst said. Apple seemingly is cutting back on some orders around Macs, iPads and AirPods over the coming quarters to reflect a softer consumer backdrop, he noted.
Ives also noted that the all-important China region saw a 7% year-over-year drop in revenue but grew on a currency-adjusted basis. He termed it an “impressive performance” despite the COVID-19 lockdowns in November and December.

PayPal's strong start in 2023 versus the S&P 500 and the analyst's cautious stance over 4Q results led to the re-rating.
While most investors expect initial 2023 revenue growth guidance to come in below the Street, Davis believes the 2023 top-line outlook will imply flat to negative growth for branded checkout, likely resulting in the share loss narrative growing even louder. 
Given new disclosures breaking out TPV by segment and specifically branded checkout and Braintree and unbranded, Davis' math suggests branded checkout likely lost share in 2022.

The ETFs are launched in partnership with Unusual Whales, which has been covering the unusual stock trading activity of members of Congress for years. Here are the details.
What Happened: In 2022, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) had its worst-performing year since 2008. That didn’t stop 20% of the members of Congress who traded stocks and options from beating the market, a number that is higher than that of professional money managers over time.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has seen increased scrutiny over the trades made by her husband Paul Pelosi, who is a venture capitalist. Many of the trades disclosed by Pelosi have shown questionable timing ahead of new policy changes and bills from Congress. Pelosi has said publicly that she does not share any information with her husband.
The increased calls to ban members of Congress from trading stocks while in office led to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) recently introducing the PELOSI Act, officially called Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act.

Microsoft is using ChatGPT to help revive its Bing search engine and compete with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google search engine.
While ChatGPT has been shown to pass major tests and exams, some have issued warning signs about the dangers that artificial intelligence can have.
Cuban is among those sounding the alarm on potential issues with ChatGPT.

Benchmark: Kurnos said Roku crushed fourth quarter expectations and provided a first quarter outlook that could have some skepticism.
“We can understand why many of our peers reacted with open skepticism, which we think highlights how far out of favor Roku has fallen,” Kurnos said.
The analyst said it’s hard to argue that Roku didn’t gain market share in the fourth quarter and could have a chance to gain more in the future.
“Roku has a chance, in our view, to prove that they have substantially more value in the ecosystem than most give them credit for.”

Companies are looking for an edge with the release or original shows and movies, live sports and other exclusives.
Here’s a look at the latest from Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) (NASDAQ: PARAA) and how it stacks up to rivals.
What Happened: Paramount Global reported revenue of $8.13 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 2% year-over-year. The company reported direct-to-consumer revenue of $1.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter, Paramount added 9.9 million subscribers for its Paramount+ streaming platform to hit a total of more than 56 million. The company added 10.8 million total global direct-to-consumer subscribers in the fourth quarter to bring the total to 77 million across several platforms.
“Paramount continues to demonstrate the success of its global multiplatform strategy, with popular content at its core. Nowhere was this more evident than in the growth of Paramount+, which added a record 9.9 million subscribers in the fourth quarter,” Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said.
Paramount also announced it will raise the prices of its streaming service as it rebrands to combine with Showtime in the third quarter of 2023. The new platform will be called Paramount+ with Showtime.
“We all know streaming represents incredible value for consumers and the Paramount Plus offering is far from the industry price leader. We are on the value end of the pricing spectrum,” Bakish said on the company’s earnings call.

Union Workers United urged the National Labor Relations Board to step in on the matter.
Tesla issued a response Thursday.
“There is a false allegation that Tesla terminated employees in response to a new union campaign,” Tesla said.
Tesla said that the firings were in response to performance reviews completed every six months.

Big Winners: Today, Apple has a massive $2.4-trillion market cap, the largest of any S&P 500 company by far. Just 23 years ago there was no iPhone, no iPad and no Apple Watch. In fact, there wasn't even an Apple iPod. At the time, Apple's market cap was a measly $16.5 billion.

With a hit show returning for a potential last season, the launch of a new sports rights package, and a series with an impressive all-star cast, AppleTV+ could have a big couple of months ahead.
What Happened: The battle for streaming rights to professional sports leagues could be one of the biggest storylines in the streaming sector. Apple secured the rights to Major League Soccer for 10 years, with the deal set to kick off in late February.
The deal will see AppleTV+ become the home of MLS coverage. Apple paid an estimated $2.5 billion for the sports rights in one of its largest streaming bets since launching AppleTV+.
Along with streaming games, Apple is also launching MLS Season Pass, a new subscription service for soccer fans in over 100 countries and regions. The MLS Season Pass has a cost of $99 per season or $79 per season for existing AppleTV+ subscribers. Monthly subscriptions are also available for $14.99 and $12.99, respectively.
The MLS 2023 regular season begins on Feb. 25 and Apple will be at the forefront of the league, which could make the streaming company a big player in the sports space.

Here’s a look at the details of the film and the person behind it.
What Happened: As the CEO of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Twitter and SpaceX, Musk is one of the most widely watched people in the world. Musk has acted in several movies and lent his voice to hits such as ""The Simpsons,” “South Park” and “Rick and Morty.”
Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney is working on a documentary titled “Musk” that will center on the life of the Tesla CEO.
The film is months into the production process, according to a report from Variety.
“I have been working on this film, off and on, for some time and am hugely excited about it,” Gibney said.
The director called the film a “definitive and unvarnished examination of multi-billionaire tech entrepreneur and CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter.”
The film is being produced by Jigsaw Productions, Closer Media, Anonymous Content and Double Agent. The film is financed by Double Agent. The report did not name a distribution partner for the documentary.

What Happened: Tesla posted its worst annual stock performance since going public in 2010 with a 69% drop in 2022. The drop in Tesla’s share price in 2022 had many expecting a rebound in 2023.
Tesla shares have rebounded in 2023 and are up over 70% year-to-date, a move that briefly saw Tesla CEO Elon Musk reclaim the title of the world’s richest person.

The tech subgroup as a whole has been down 14% since the bear market began at the start of 2022, the analyst said.

This, in other words, is value investing — a strategy that is central to billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s  investment thesis. Clinton took up Buffett’s bet in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) as a case study to back his view.

Here’s a look at how Buffett got started with Berkshire Hathaway and how much investing alongside him could have been worth.
What Happened: Buffett is one of the greatest investors of the current generation and is known for a buy-and-hold approach for investing. He also uses that approach in his life, living in the same house for the past 65 years.
Before his buy-and-hold approach used today, Buffett was interested in buying low-priced stocks in the 1960s, including companies that were well-run but trading at low prices.
“If (the stocks) were cheap enough, he didn’t care it was a lousy company and lousy management. He knew he was going to make money anyways because of the cheapness,” Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said in the “Becoming Warren Buffett Documentary,” CNBC reported.
Buffett bought his first shares of textile company Berkshire Hathaway in December 1962 for $7.50 each.

Analyst Color: 
“While higher rates have already wreaked havoc on an overheated housing market and an overextended banking sector, corporate borrowers are going to continue to feel the sting,” said Daniel Berkowitz, investment director at Prudent Management Associates.
The analyst said the pandemic allowed companies to enjoy debt on extremely favorable terms. As this debt matures over the next few years, companies will likely have to refinance at potentially materially higher rates, he said. Higher interest expense, the analyst said, might drag down corporate earnings and put pressure on market prices.

Five months later, when Musk became the owner and CEO of Twitter, his rampage — as the billionaire began to cut the social media’s staff in droves — echoed throughout the tech industry.
Musk’s eccentricity is paired with a hardline attitude that appears unforgiving. One expert, Delivering Happiness CEO Jenn Lim, went as far as to refer to Musk’s handling of Twitter layoffs as “inhumane,” according to Forbes.

They used them to fulfill their allocation needs quickly, and because of the high liquidity of the ETFs, given the ecosystem around the ETFs that include authorized participants, the market makers, and the ways that they handle both creations and redemptions, the fund manager said.

Below is a summary of how these 23 analysts rated Apple over the past 3 months. The ...Full story available on Benzinga.com---newarticle--- Apple, Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) was edging up about 0.5% on Thursday after closing Wednesday’s session about 2% higher on the break up from a bull flag pattern.  Bullish momentum may have followed on Thursday, but the market is likely waiting to see headline PCE data, which is expected Friday morning.
The bull flag pattern is created with a sharp rise higher forming the pole, which is then followed by a consolidation pattern that brings the stock lower between a channel with parallel lines or into a tightening triangle pattern.
For bearish traders, the ""trend is your friend"" (until it's not) and the stock may continue downward within the following channel for a short period of time. Aggressive traders may decide to short the stock at the upper trendline and exit the trade at the lower trendline.

Complementary, Not Competitive:  Taking an offensive approach, Apple and Disney are worth more together than separately, analyst Laura Martin said in a note.
“We believe that great content and a strong distribution footprint are complementary networks. That is, both are worth more if they have the other,” she said.
Martin noted that Apple is best at distributing content globally to 2 billion high-end mobile devices owned by 1.25 billion unique, wealthy users. Disney is best at creating AAA content franchises, which it distributes globally across all screens, as well as in the physical world, she added.

Interest-rate sensitive mega caps, such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), have gained more than 2% on the day. A weaker greenback, with EUR/USD hitting fresh yearly highs, also supported stock advances. 
Cues From Thursday's Trading: 
Producer price inflation (PPI) decreased by 0.5% in March, falling short of forecasts for a flat monthly reading, while weekly unemployment claims surged by 11,000 to 239,000, above expectations. The two findings signal that a cooling trend in pricing pressures and the labor market is already underway.
Stocks rallied across the board as investors wagered the Federal Reserve will stop raising in June and deliver the first reduction as early as July, according to latest CME Group FedWatch tool.
The S&P 500 index gained 0.7%, returning above 4,100 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average grew 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed, gaining 1.4%. Small caps in the Russell 2000 index were also higher, up 0.9%.

Markowitz’s Nobel Prize-winning work demonstrated that investment classes should not be considered individually. Instead, investors should analyze the combined expected returns and risks of different combinations of asset classes. Markowitz looked at expected returns and risks based on historical data, using volatility as a measure of the “riskiness” of an investment.
Volatility Is Key
Here's a modern example of the type of correlations Markowitz considered: an investment in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and two of its suppliers, such as Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM), might seem like one big investment in the iPhone. However, if the suppliers entered a price war to compete with each other, their margins would shrink and share prices might fall. Apple, on the other hand, would be paying less for its parts and would see an increase in margins (and share price).

Markowitz would consider these intertwined relationships between different investments rather than the individual stocks themselves.

Analyst Color: 
The Fed could stay on course despite the economic slowdown and raise rates at the upcoming May 2-3 meeting, according to Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist at LPL Financial.
“Businesses appeared to hunker down under the weight of tighter credit conditions and weaker economic growth. If small businesses are an accurate barometer, recession risks are rising and the labor market will likely cool in the coming months,” the analyst said. He does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut by the end of the year if the economy becomes more unstable.

Apple Preps To Press The Pedal? Given Apple is a leading player in nearly everything regarding tech and consumer technology, the company will likely step up its AI efforts over the coming months, Ives said in a recent note.
The company's thrust on AI is evident from the 2020 acquisition of Xnor.ai, a spin-off from the non-profit Allen Institute for AI, he said. The tech giant would have the opportunity to leverage Xnor.ai capabilities into standard features within every iPhone, iPad and MacBook, including object and person recognition tools, he added.
The analyst also noted that Xnor.ai has recently developed a self-service platform for software developers to drop AI-centric code and data libraries into device-centric apps, allowing users to use AI models anywhere.

Prices as of 4 pm EST, 5/3/23
Macro
The Fed unanimously raised interest rates by 25 bps, bringing the benchmark rate above 5%.


For the first time since August 2019, the target rate is now higher than headline inflation.


The FOMC used more flexible language in its statement that left the door open for a pause at its next meeting.


However, Powell stressed that a rate cut in 2023—as markets expect—was not a part of the current outlook.



The latest ISM purchasing managers index revealed a services sector growing steadily.


April’s headline reading edged up to 51.9 from 51.2 in March driven by a surge in new orders and a rebound in exports.


Prices paid by businesses also edged up, however, suggesting inflationary pressures remain.



In contrast with Tuesday’s JOLTs data, yesterday’s ADP payroll numbers point to a resilient labor market.


US companies added 296,000 jobs in April, more than double the expected amount and the most since July.


Not exactly what the Fed wants to see.


Wage growth, on the other hand, suggests a cooling market as annual pay gains decelerated to 6.7%.
